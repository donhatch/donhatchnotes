Q: how to make F1 raise the current window and F2 lower it?
A: I put this at the end of ~/Documents/AutoHotKey.ahk
        F1::
            MouseGetPos, xpos, ypos, id, control
            ;Msgbox, F1 pressed. The cursor is at x=%xpos% y=%ypos% id=%id% control=%control%
            WinSet, Top, , ahk_id %id%
        return

        F2::
            MouseGetPos, xpos, ypos, id, control
            ;Msgbox, F2 pressed. The cursor is at x=%xpos% y=%ypos% id=%id% control=%control%

Q: how to fence a scrollbar so it doesn't snapback?  (see scrollbars notes)
PA: hack up ControlFence: http://www.donationcoder.com/Software/Skrommel/index.html#ControlFence
    however that only works with native scrollbars--
    some apps use them:
        gvim
        procexp
    some don't :-(
        firefox
        chrome
        cmd console
        console2
        ConEmu

Q: can I emulate middle mouse button by simultaneous(-enough) left-and-right click?
