Possibly precious file:  ~/Documents/AutoHotKey.ahk
(although I don't put anything in it any more)

==============================================
Towards better checking of stuff,
see utilities by Adrian Hawryluk
    ClassCheck.ahk
    DllCallCheck.ahk
    object.ahk


Really good working examples of syntax:
    http://www.daviddeley.com/autohotkey/xprxmp/autohotkey_expression_examples.htm

Tips/Tricks:

    - During development of a hotkey script,
      put in this hotkey (comment it out when not developing):
          ^!r::Reload ; Assign ctrl-alt-r as hotkey to restart this script
      (Actually it needs to be smarter than Reload
      to get the original args... see my Reload.ahk)

    - Search for the following that are probably errors:
        / = /  (most likely should be :=
        / , *$/ (i.e. comma at end of line)

Best Practices:
    - Try to do all work inside functions,
      rather than subroutines, so as to keep scratch variables
      out of the global namespace.  Avoid temptation to do stuff
      directly in the subroutines even though it's easier initially,
      since as soon as you need a scratch variable you'll regret it.


Q: how can I make the text in an Edit *not* be highlighted initially?
A: http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/94102-solvedgui-edit-and-highlight-some-text-or-insert-formatted-text-in-edit/
    EM_SETSEL:=0x0B1
    SendMessage EM_SETSEL,0,4,,ahk_id %hEdit%
    ;-- Select the first 4 characters of the Edit control


Q: can I make it intercept keystrokes to really unfriendly apps
   like java and gimp, and make them do the right thing?
   (i.e. don't raise window when it gets focus--
   especially when it gets focus by x-mouse!
   maybe implement x-mouse in AutoHotKey?)

Q: how to make F1 raise the current window and F2 lower it?
PA: I put this at the end of ~/Documents/AutoHotKey.ahk
        F1::
            MouseGetPos, xpos, ypos, id, control
            ;Msgbox, F1 pressed. The cursor is at x=%xpos% y=%ypos% id=%id% control=%control%
            WinSet, Top, , ahk_id %id%
        return

        F2::
            MouseGetPos, xpos, ypos, id, control
            ;Msgbox, F2 pressed. The cursor is at x=%xpos% y=%ypos% id=%id% control=%control%
            WinSet, Bottom, , ahk_id %id%
        return

    Hmm but it only works for some windows...
    in others (like ConEmu), it only works in the title bar?
    Oh wait maybe that's interaction with txmouse? Bleah!
    (but it's pointless without some kind of x-mouse)
    And if the ConEmu is being run by Admin, it just sends A or B?
    (i.e. it doesn't work there, that's what F1 and F2 do
    when the script isn't running)


Q: how to fence a scrollbar so it doesn't snapback?  (see scrollbars notes)
PA: hack up ControlFence: http://www.donationcoder.com/Software/Skrommel/index.html#ControlFence
    however that only works with native scrollbars--
    some apps use them:
        gvim
        procexp
    some don't :-(
        firefox
        chrome
        cmd console
        console2
        ConEmu

Q: can I emulate middle mouse button by simultaneous(-enough) left-and-right click?

Q: how to I express multi-line text in the middle of a script?
A: e.g.
    text := "first line`n"
          . "second line`n"
          . "third line"
    MsgBox, %text%


Q: is there a way to run it from command line (tcsh)
   in such a way that ctrl-c will kill it?
PA: hmm, can I trace parent processes and find the parent shell window,
   and make a window-specific ctrl-c hotkey
   that exits the script?

Q: is there an autohotkey clipboard slash tilter?
   (i.e. something that takes the clipboard contents
   and tilts it from a windows filename to a unix filename or vice versa)
   or can I write one?

Q: can I make a simple image viewer in ahk?
   all the image viewers take too long to start
   and/or don't have zoom that allows pixel inspection.
A: yes, did it (myImageViewer.ahk TODO: publish it)

Q: why is this program not acting like I expect:

        MsgBox(msg)
        {
            MsgBox, % msg
        }

        if (true) MsgBox("this should be msg box 1")
        if (true) MsgBox("this should be msg box 2")
        if (true) MsgBox("this should be msg box 3")
        if (false) MsgBox("this shouldn't happen A")
        if (false) MsgBox("this shouldn't happen B")
        if (false) MsgBox("this shouldn't happen C")
        MsgBox("this should be msg box 4")
        MsgBox("this should be msg box 5")
        MsgBox("this should be msg box 6")

    expected output:
        this should be msg box 1
        this should be msg box 2
        this should be msg box 3
        this should be msg box 4
        this should be msg box 5
        this should be msg box 6
    actual output:
        this should be msg box 1
        this should be msg box 2
        this should be msg box 3
        this shouldn't happen A
        this should be msg box 5
        this should be msg box 6

Q: how to compile a .ahk program into a .exe program?
A: simplest way is probably to right-click in explorer -> Compile Script.
   or on command line:
        Ahk2exe.exe /in "MyScript.ahk"
        Ahk2exe.exe /in "MyScript.ahk" /icon "MyIcon.ico" /pass "CustomPassword" /NoDecompile
   make sure you're not already running a pre-existing .exe,
   or you'll get a somewhat cryptic failure.


Q: 90% of my time is spent tracking down fallout from nonexistent
   variables due to typos or failure to declare something global.
   can I please have a "strict" mode
   that will make it give a clear error message
   instead of silently doing something wrong
   when I:
       - refer to a nonexistent or uninitialized variable,
       - call a nonexistent method,
       - do ops on vars that don't make sense,
       - use = when I meant :=
       - use + or += when I meant . or .=
       - say "foo"."bar" when I meant "foo" . "bar" or "foo" "bar"
       - say Substr(str, 0, len) when I meant Substr(str, 1, len)
       - pass an object member variable to a function that takes it as ByRef
           (doesn't work)
       - say "new Object()" instead of "Object()"
       - call VarSetCapacity on a member variable
           (have to call Obj.SetCapacity(member)
           and Obj.GetCapacity(member) instead)
       - refer to &obj.member (it returns blank;
           (have to say obj.GetAddress("member") instead)
       - call NumSet(obj.member, offset, "int")
         or NumGet(obj.member, offset)
         (have to say NumGet(obj.GetAddress("member")+offset))
       - call NumGet(addr, "int") or NumPut(x, addr, offset, "int")
         (have to say NumGet(addr+0, "int")
          or NumPut(x, addr+0, offset, "int") instead)
       - passing misspelled or nonexistent type to NumGet or NumPut
       - put a space between the function name and the opening '('
       - call a function by name (i.e. %functionName%(arg1,arg2,...))
         and pass it the wrong number of args
       - screw up something like this (can you spot the bug?)
            Gdip_DrawImage(G3, globalBitmap2,   ; dst,src
                         , dstX0, dstY0, dstX1-dstX0, dstY1-dstY0
                         , dstX0, dstY0, dstX1-dstX0, dstY1-dstY0)
       - or this (can you spot the bug?
            AHKsock_AsyncSend(iSocket, ptrData, iLength
                            , startedFunc, startedFuncArg
                            , progressFunc, progressFuncArg
                            , finishedFunc, finishedFuncArg)
                            , failureFunc, failureFuncArg)
            {
                ; ...
            }
   (answers: extra comma, extra paren)
