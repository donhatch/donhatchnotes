Web based:
   - http://www.colorzilla.com/ "Advanced Colorful Goodies"
     - cool!
     - install colorzilla extension, its eyedropper is limited to within chrome,
       but it's cool-- it continuously shows rgb!
     - and has a color chooser, similar to the ones fin other apps

I have (or can easily install) the following on ubuntu;
they all have color choosers with eyedroppers:

- gimp has most awesome color chooser:
   - "GIMP Selector":
       - slider (any of h,s,v,r,g,b) and square for other two--
         this is actually awesome!
         could maybe enhance by adding all of gpick's
         other 3-slider schemes too?
   - CMYK
     - kind of lame:
       - the gradient should appear on the slider like fo h,s,v,r,g,b
       - should be able to show this at same time as the GIMP
         selector, and make it one of the options (I think?
         not clear how the 4 dimensions work and map to 3)
   - Triangle selector
       hue circle, sat/val triangle that's kind of a pointer
       this is actually pretty sweet! tri more elegant
       than square in this case.
   - watercolor mode doesn't seem to relevant or useful to me
- gpick is quite awesome as well
   - it has an eyedropper that shows the rgb under mouse continuously...
     it's the only standard tool I know that does!
     hit spacebar to put the picked color on the palette.
   - extensive 3-slider options (and cmyk which is 4-slider),
     can show them all simultaneously and updating.  Bravo!
   - and also a selector something like gimp's triangle selector,
     for the scheme generation pane... and can show that at same time
     as the Color picker (View -> Secondary View -> Sceme Generation;
     if secondary view has zero height at bottom, stretch it)
     except they don't update each other so not that useful to have them up
     at the same time
- agave
  - seems like it was beta software that never really got off the ground--
    seems like everything it does, gpick can do better,
    except its doc is what helped me understand what the scheme types
    are doing, gpick doesn't have doc

Actually I think I can do better than any of these!
Should experiment.

Should include best of everything:
    - all of what the GIMP Selector shows
      - actually maybe all 6 slices at once? hmm!
        - well certainly the ones for r,g,b can be shown naturally
          as different cross-sections of the same color cube...
        - and maybe the hsv ones can be shown as simultaneous
          cross sections of something too? a double-cone?
    - all of gpick's 3-and-4-slider options
      at same time, like gpick does, and at same time as GIMP selector
      (gimp does rgb and hsv as part of GIMP Selector)
    - html
    - eyedropper with little mag window, like gpick-- nice
    - note that colorzilla has a colorchooser with 2d gradients, in chrome--
      so it is possible-- not sure whether it uses opengl acceleration or not.
