Q: how to ask what version of stuff is installed on cygwin?
A: 
    % cygcheck -f /usr/bin/rcs.exe
        rcs-5.7-11
    % cygcheck -c rcs
        Cygwin Package Information
        Package              Version        Status
        rcs                  5.7-11         OK

----------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: rcs-5.8.1-1 and rcs-5.8.2-1 have a very serious bug!
5.7.11 doesn't.

Subject: ssh takes forever to interrupt-- known problem?

ssh'ing from a cygwin shell to a linux computer,
if I run an output-bound command
(e.g. "yes aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa")
and I try to kill the command
using ctrl-c, it takes a long time, sometimes several minutes.
I'd love to get this fixed, as it's the one thing
that's preventing me from using cygwin/ssh effectively
as a remote terminal.

The problem occurs in the following situations:
    - cygwin ssh from windows to linux
    - cygwin ssh from windows to localhost
The problem does NOT occur in the following situations:
    - ssh from putty on windows to linux
    - ssh from linux to cygwin sshd on windows
    - ssh from linux to linux

So the problem seems to be unique to the cygwin ssh client.
Is this a known problem?
Any ideas why it would be like this for only this client,
and whether there are any inherent technical difficulties
that would make it hard to fix?

Note there is a post about this behavior on serverfault:
    http://serverfault.com/questions/32159/what-do-you-do-when-a-command-floods-your-terminal-with-too-much-output
although it doesn't mention it being specific to cygwin ssh.

Q: I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE SETUP PROGRAM!
   I sent the following message to cygwin at cygwin.com:

    ==========================================
    Subject: baffling cygwin setup.exe behavior

    I've always been baffled by cygwin setup's behavior.
    I wish I understood it and could control it.

    Here is a typical example where I want to do something
    very simple and I have no idea how to get the setup program
    to do it.  Help!

    My goal: upgrade rcs to the "currently considered most stable"
    version, without changing anything else on the system.

    I run "cygcheck -c rcs", which outputs:
        Cygwin Package Information
        Package              Version        Status
        rcs                  5.7-11         OK
    I run cygwin setup-x86.exe.
    The splash window says "Setup.exe version 2.829 (32 bit)".
       I click Next.
    On the next window I select "Install from Internet",
       and click Next.
    On the next window I select
       Root Directory: C:\cygwin
       Install For: All Users
       and click Next.
    On the next window I select
       Local Package Directory: C:\Users\hatch\Downloads
       and click Next.
    On the next window I select "Direct Connection"
       and click Next.
    On the next window I select the download site
       http://cygwin.mirrors.hoobly.com
       and click Next.
    It quickly downloads some stuff and
       puts me in the "Select Packages" window,
       with the "Curr" radio button selected and View=Category.

    First I browse around to see what the "Curr" world looks
    like (i.e. "Globally select the version that is currently
    considered the most stable. (RECOMMENDED)" according
    to the tooltip.
    I open the Devel folder and scroll down to the "rcs" row,
    which says:
       Current = 5.7-11
       New = <arrows> 5.8.2-1
       Bin? = [X]
       Src? = [ ]
       Size = 286k
       Package = rcs: The Revision Control system
    So far I think this makes sense:
    yes, I have 5.7-11 installed, and I want to upgrade to 5.8.2-1.
    I click on the "<arrows> 5.8.2-1" to see what other
    possibilities are available for this package.
    It goes through the following values:
       <arrows> 5.8.2-1   (initial value)
       <arrows> Keep
       <arrows> 5.8.1-1
       <arrows> Uninstall
       <arrows> Keep
       <arrows> 5.8.1-1
       <arrows> Uninstall
       ...
    Huh?  Once I've clicked it once,
    it never cycles back to the initial value
    of 5.8.2-1.  So that's baffling thing #1.
    (The only way I can see to get it to show 5.8.2-1 again
    is to globally change from "Curr" to something else
    and then back to "Curr".)

    Next, I change the global radio button
    from "Curr" to "Keep"
    (i.e. "Sets all packages to their currently installed version.
    This is equivalent to telling setup not to make any changes
    to any package." according to the tooltip).
    I think this is the right thing to do
    since since I don't want to change any packages except rcs--
    I figure I will now be able to change just rcs individually.

    I open the Devel folder again and scroll down to the "rcs" row,
    which now says:
       Current = 5.7-11
       New = <arrows> Keep
       Bin? = n/a
       Src? = n/a
       Size = ?
       Package = rcs: The Revision Control System
    When I click on the "<arrows> Keep" it cycles through:
       <arrows> Keep      (initial value)
       <arrows> 5.8.1-1
       <arrows> Uninstall
       <arrows> Keep
       <arrows> 5.8.1-1
       <arrows> Uninstall
       ...
    Huh?  My desired value of 5.8.2-1 isn't available
    from here at all???  That's baffling thing #2.

    So, as far as I can see,
    the only way to get rcs 5.8.2-1 is to globally select "Curr"
    and *don't click on rcs at all*.
    So, to upgrade rcs and nothing else,
    I'd have to globally select "Curr"
    and manually change every package *except* rcs
    to "Keep", leaving rcs alone.
    That seemed like a lot of work and error prone
    (and I knew I was going to be doing all this several times)
    and who knows whether I'd run into other problems on the way.
    So instead, I elected to upgrade
    my entire system to "Curr", even though
    that's not really what I wanted.

    If anyone can explain what's going on here
    (is it a bug? or something wrong with my thinking?)
    and how to do this simple operation,
    I'd really appreciate it!
