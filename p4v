QUESTIONS:
Q: Change list descriptions get cut off.
   Sometimes double-clicking on the change, which puts it into the Details tab,
   makes the full description get loaded, but maybe not.
   How can I force the full description to get loaded?
   (Oh hmm, maybe I was mistaken and details always loads it, not sure)

Q: Also, in the Time Lapse View and Revision Graph View,
   sometimes it says "View changelist to see the full description".
   What's the quickest way to get to the changelist, from there?
   (The changelist number is shown but I don't see how to bring
   up the description.)


Q: Help says:
    The Perforce Visual Client Help files can not be found.
    Do you want to locate them?
   How do I find them?

ANSWERED QUESTIONS:

Q: Is there a time lapse diff, like that other tool I think I remember?
A: Turn on different aspects, using the buttons at the top
   of the Time Lapse View.  I think that covers everything I'd want.
   (Probably what I'm remembering is a CVS tool.)
