(I think this was just in some old version of suse... hasn't happened
since we upgraded to centos 5)

When tcsh history gets messed up...

To print out history with time stamps:
    history -hT
To get date in a number:
    date +%s
To translate from number to date:
    write a program that does ctime :-(

Interesting... when it's messing up,
I think it's in a mode in which it just never updates
from what was originally read from .history.
I can set history = 0 and back, and it never gets more.

env is the same in good as bad shell
history is same in good as bad shell

When bad, can set history to 0 and back to 100, doesn't help
When bad, can read in history from ~/.history using history -L ...
it changes the history to the contents of .history, but then it stays
that way.
