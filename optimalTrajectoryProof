Actually as the velocity path degenerates toward a straight line segment, scale need not go to infinity--
it could also be taken to be a segment of a unit-scaled (or arbitrarily scaled) cosh graph that is farther and farther from the origin, since such a segment becomes straighter and straighter.  So there is lots of ambiguity in this case.
Again, that's with any parametrization I can think of...
however there still might be some clever parametrization that would make this problem disappear by making all straight segments converge to the same parameters, somehow.

Also, I think I misremembered when I was talking about it the other day:
integrating the velocity (some rotated/scaled/translated catenary, parametrized by arc length) isn't hard;
wolframalpha does it no problem.
The part that's the pain is finding the appropriate rotation/scale/translation of the cosh function in velocity space
so that it passes through the desired start and end velocities
and so that the path integral is the desired position displacement.
One might think this could be done with something like a newton solve, but in practice it behaves rather awfully
in certain places (with any parametrization I could think of).
One thing that seems to make it nasty is that when the catenary segment degenerates to a straight line segment (or nearly one) the rotate/scale/translate is not unique
(scale is infinity, but which infinitesimal part of the cosh graph is it? could be any)

Nah, that's just a geometric fact about the catenary, I don't think it says anything I didn't already know.

Okay, I've been reading the treatment of the maximum principle
in Daniel Liberzon's book
"Calculus of variations and optimal control theory":
http://liberzon.csl.illinois.edu/teaching/cvoc.pdf

Following Example 4.4.1 on page 107, but in R^n instead of R,
I've verified my conjecture, as follows.
As in the example, we can deduce the following about the solution
costate p1*,p2*:
    dp1*/dt is 0, so p1* is some constant vector c1
    dp2*/dt is -p1* = -c1 so p2* is c2 - c1 t for some other constant vector c2.
Then the Hamiltonian maximization condition says that at all times t,
the optimal control (acceleration) u*
must be the unit vector that maximizes p2* dot u*;
in other words, u* is the unit vector in the direction of p2* = c2 - c1 t,
i.e. u* = (c2 - c1 t) / ||c2 - c1 t||
(like I've been saying all along!).
Integrate that over time and the result (the velocity) is a catenary
traversed at unit speed, like I said.

As for additional geometric insight, 
I think there's only one piece 
of the maximum principle statement that I haven't looked at fully for this case:
that is, the condition that H is 0 at all times along the optimal trajectory.
That amounts to saying that
        c1 dot x2 + ||c2 - c1 t|| = 1  for all t
where x2 is the velocity and c1,c2 are the constant vectors comprising the
costate, as above.  
Maybe this says something interesting or useful,
but I'm not sure what at the moment.

Haven't had a chance to think about this.

The standard tool for solving these kinds of problems is, I think, the Pontryagin Minimum Principle. There are some readable accounts on the web, but wikipedia isn't one of them.

FWIW Using the Pontryagin principle often gives some additional insight into the geometry of the problem.

Thinking about this more, I think the proof of Lemma 2
needs the following additional fact:
that the set of all centroids of paths of given length from a to b
is convex.  This is established by the following two additional Lemmas:

Lemma 1.8: Given any two points a and b in R^n, and a length l,
the set {centroid(P): P is a path of length *at most* l from a to b}
is convex.

    Sketch of proof of Lemma 1.8: Given c0, c1 in the set, let P0,P1
    be paths of length <= l from a to b with c0=centroid(P0), c1=centroid(P1).
    Then for any intermediate point ct = c0+t*(c1-c0) (0<t<1),
    we can construct a path Pt with centroid ct by "blending" P0 and P1:
    That is, start with a linear pointwise blend
    of parametrizations of P0 and P1; the graph of the resulting blended function
    has length <= l as required, and the blended function has average value ct;
    however if we reparametrize it by arc length, it may no longer have
    average value ct.
    [Not sure what the cleanest way to complete this is.
    Seems clear that we can "pad out" the graph of the blended function
    by adding little loops here and there, so that the result
    has length <= l and average value ct, but details seem messy.]

Lemma 1.9: Given any two points a and b in R^n, and a length l,
the set {centroid(P): P is a path of length *exactly* l from a to b}
is convex.

    Proof of Lemma 1.9: Given c0,c1 in the set
    and intermediate point ct between them, Lemma 1.8 gives
    a path P with centroid ct and length <= l.
    Pad P out to a path of length exactly l, as follows:
    Take any n+1 points (where n is the dimension of the space) on P,
    having ct in their convex hull. Augment P by adding a little loop
    at each of these points, in appropriate proportions
    so that their centroid is ct.  Then the result still has centroid ct.

~~~~~~~~~~~~
So... proof of Lemma 1.8 needs more work.  I suspect it might
be worthwhile in the statements of Lemmas 1.8,1.9,2 and maybe 3
to relax the restriction that the path from a to b be traversed at constant speed; that might make the proofs go through more easily.

Been thinking about the problem a bit as I was driving to and from work
yesterday, and I think I finally have a proof.

Recall the problem:
  Given, in R^n (wlog n<=3):
      p0 = initial position
      v0 = initial velocity
      p1 = final position
      v1 = final velocity
  Find minimal t1 such that there is a trajectory p(t)
  with first and second derivatives v(t) and a(t) (velocity and acceleration)
  such that v(t) is continuous and piecewise differentiable and:
      p(0) = p0
      v(0) = v0
      p(t1) = p1
      v(t1) = v1
    ||a(t)|| <= 1 everywhere it's defined (which is everywhere except
                  possibly some isolated points)

Proposition: if p is an optimal trajectory (i.e. solution to the stated problem)
then the velocity vector function v(t)=p'(t)
traces out a catenary in velocity space, at constant speed (namely 1).
(A straight line segment, with an optional single switchback,
is considered to be a specific case of a catenary.)

The (sketch of) proof rests on the following Lemmas.

Lemma 1 (well known in kinodynamic programming literature, I believe):
If p is an optimal trajectory, then ||a(t)|| == 1 everywhere it is defined.
Sketch of Proof of Lemma 1:
Let p be such that ||a(t)|| != 1 for some t; we'll show it's not optimal.
By continuity and compactness or something (not sure at the moment),
there exists some epsilon such that
||a(t)|| < 1-epsilon for all t in some small interval of t's.
This gives some slack so that we can improve p
while still following exactly the same path,
by applying slight acceleration and then deceleration
during that small interval of the path, mild enough so that all the problem
constraints are still satisfied.

Lemma 2: Given any points a and b in R^n,
and path P from a to b, if P is not a catenary,
there exists r>0 such that for any point c~
within distance r from P's center of mass CM(P),
there's a path P~ from a to b,
of same length as P, such that CM(P~) = c~.
Very handwavy sketch of proof of Lemma 2:
This follows (somehow) from the fact that, for every direction vector,
P is not a catenary hanging in that direction
and therefore, by well-known optimality property of catenaries,
P does not maximize the dot product of the center-of-mass
with that direction vector.
(And probably needs continuity and/or compactness in the argument.)

Lemma 3: Given any points a and b in R^n,
and path P from a to b, if P is not a catenary,
there exists r>0 such that for any point m~
within distance r from P's moment CM(P)*length(P),
there's a path P~ from a to b,
of same length as P, such that the moment of P~ is m~.
Proof:  This is the same as Lemma 2, but with moment(P)=CM(P)*length(P)
in place of CM(P).  So this follows immediately from Lemma 2
with r here being length(P) times the r from Lemma 2.

Sketch of proof of Proposition:
Assume we have a trajectory p(t) satisfying the problem constraints
but whose velocity v(t) does not trace out a catenary at constant speed
in velocity space; we will show p can be improved and is therefore not optimal.
We know by Lemma 1 that v(t) traces out *some* path of length t1
at constant speed in velocity space, so the assumption is
that it's not a catenary.

In particular, it's not a straight line segment,
so we can find an instant t at which its curvature is nonzero
(or a switchback, at which curvature is undefined but it will work as well).
For some small epsilon (which we'll nail down later), we'll modify v
to a new velocity function v~
by replacing the part of the velocity curve from v(t-epsilon) to v(t+epsilon)
by its chord, thereby strictly shortening the curve in velocity space
to some length t1~ < t1.
Let v~(t) from t=0 to t=t1~
be the function obtained by following this modified curve
at speed 1 in velocity space.
So now v~ has the desired length (shorter than v) and endpoints v0,v1,
but its integral, i.e. the total position displacement, is wrong;
it's (most likely) not p1-p0.
We'll now further modify v~, without changing its length t1~
or its endpoints v0,v1,
to get a new function v~~ that has the desired
original total position displacement p1-p0.

Consider the r of Lemma 3 to be a function r(P) of the path P,
It's clearly a continuous function of P
(with respect to some standard notion of distance among functions, I'm sure);
that is, when P is perturbed by only a small amount,
then r(P) will change by only a small amount.
Similary, define r(v) and r(v~) to be r of the respective paths traced out
by those unit-speed functions;
then we can make r(v~) arbitrarily close to r(v)
by making v~ sufficiently close to v.

So... choose epsilon small enough so that
v~ is close enough to v so that:
    (1) |r(v~)-r(v)| < r(v)/2, so that r(v~) > r(v)/2
    (2) ||moment(v~)-moment(v)|| < r(v)/2
So then
    ||moment(v)-moment(v~)|| < r(v)/2   by (2)
                             < r(v~)    by (1)
so, since r(v~) is the r of Lemma 3,
there exists a function v~~(t)
with same length and endpoints as v~,
such that moment(v~~) = moment(v) = p1-p0.

Define p~~ as the integral of v~~ starting at p~~(0)=p0;
then p~~ satisfies all the problem constraints
and is an improvement over p, as desired.

Yeah!
