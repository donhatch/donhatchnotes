x-mouse aka focus-follows-mouse aka sloppy focus.

Good summary here (the stuff about dead buffaloes and durians):

Highlights of partial workarounds:
  - iTerm2 (which is a nice Terminal replacement anyway) has it,
    but only within the same app:
      Preferences -> Pointer -> Focus follows mouse
  - Oh! Terminal actually has same thing, with obscure enabling recipe per:
      http://stackoverflow.com/questions/98310/focus-follows-mouse-plus-auto-raise-on-mac-os-x#answer-98331
        defaults write com.apple.Terminal FocusFollowsMouse -bool true
  - hmm, actually, they work great together, *as long as iTerm2 is on top*.
  - per http://stackoverflow.com/questions/98310/focus-follows-mouse-plus-auto-raise-on-mac-os-x#answer-35820182 :
      ⌃⌥-click (control-option-click) - switches focus without raising window
      ⌘-click (command-click) - clicks in window without switching focus,
         can do many operations (unfortunately not too helpful when I want
         to copy text, since that requires keys too)
    control-option-click seems to work well for Terminal and chrome, but not
    for iTerm2 (iTerm2 brings up the right-click menu? wonder if there's
    a way to disable that?  or file bug against iTerm2)
  - "scroll-follows-mouse" is on by default (or maybe always)

  - in the ycombinator thread, someone suggested using some applescript
    (with accessibility enabled so can control windows and mouse)
  - in http://superuser.com/questions/27306/focus-follows-mouse-or-sloppy-focus-on-mac-os-x#answer-334078 ey suggests writing an "input manager" that can
    redirect the keystrokes/clicks using mach_inject or similar.
    Details are flawed, but that might be a good technology to use
    in other ways.
    Oh, ouch!  mach_inject looks scary! It's remote process code injection!
    Forget that.  It would be great to be able to intercept key/mouse events
    and direct them, though.

  - Event tap?
      https://encyclopediaofdaniel.com/blog/os-x-event-tap/
      https://developer.apple.com/reference/coregraphics/quartz_event_services
    Hmm, looks like it's either Swift or Objective-C?  Not applescript.
  - Possibly relevant stuff about event architecture, with diagram:

  - Seems like this goes into the too hard pile :-(
