x-mouse aka focus-follows-mouse aka sloppy focus.

Highlights of partial workarounds on OS X (mac)::
  - iTerm2 (which is a nice Terminal replacement anyway) has it,
    but only within the same app:
      Preferences -> Pointer -> Focus follows mouse
  - Oh! Terminal actually has it within same app too, with obscure enabling recipe per:
      http://stackoverflow.com/questions/98310/focus-follows-mouse-plus-auto-raise-on-mac-os-x#answer-98331
        defaults write com.apple.Terminal FocusFollowsMouse -bool true
  - hmm, actually, they work great together, *as long as iTerm2 is on top*.
  - per http://stackoverflow.com/questions/98310/focus-follows-mouse-plus-auto-raise-on-mac-os-x#answer-35820182 :
      ⌃⌥-click (control-option-click) - switches focus without raising window
      ⌘-click (command-click) - clicks in window without switching focus,
         can do many operations (unfortunately not too helpful when I want
         to copy text, since that requires keys too)
    control-option-click seems to work well for Terminal and chrome, but not
    for iTerm2 (iTerm2 raises the window *and* brings up the right-click menu? just like ctrl-click does. wonder if there's
    a way to disable that?  or file bug against iTerm2? or submit a patch for it?)
    - to *partially* disable it: preferences -> Pointer -> check "^-click reported to apps, does not open menu".  The "does not open menu" part is desired, the "reported to apps" part is not!  (since that raises the window, dammit!)
      What Terminal does works well, what is that?  It seems that the first ctrl-alt-click gives it focus, the *second* one raises and brings up menu.  Yeah I want that?
      I think what Terminal does, which is what I want, is something like: "^-alt-click when not focused focuses without raising?"
      Bigger picture, it seems iterm2 does not have any way to "focus without raising" (with respect to other apps-- within iterm2, xmouse does
      achieve that among iterm2 windows).
      Even better would be hotkeys (so I don't have to touch the mouse) for:
          - focus window under mouse cursor without bringing to front
          - raise window under mouse cursor (focusing it is fine, probably)
          - lower window under mouse cursor
    - and, workaround for *that* -- ctrl-n to create a new iterm window, make it tiny and stick it in a corner of the screen;
      then when I want focus to be on an iterm2 window without raising it, click on that tiny window instead.
      It pops to front, but who cares because it's small and not obscuring anything.
      Rough edge: if I create a new window in the focused-but-not-raised app, then close the new window, the focused-but-not-raised app will come to front :-( also lots of other things make come to front too, e.g. hitting ctrl-w in chrome :-( maybe file bug on that?
  - UPDATE: iTerm2 *does* have (partial) focus-follows-mouse interaction with other apps after all!
      It's under Preferences... -> Advanced -> Experimental Features -> Mouse -> "When Focus Follows Mouse is enabled, steal key focus even when inactive -> Yes
      See iterm2 notes for notes on how far this gets us


  - "scroll-follows-mouse" is on by default (or maybe always)

  - in the ycombinator thread, someone suggested using some applescript
    (with accessibility enabled so can control windows and mouse)
  - in http://superuser.com/questions/27306/focus-follows-mouse-or-sloppy-focus-on-mac-os-x#answer-334078 ey suggests writing an "input manager" that can
    redirect the keystrokes/clicks using mach_inject or similar.
    Details are flawed, but that might be a good technology to use
    in other ways.
    Oh, ouch!  mach_inject looks scary! It's remote process code injection!
    Forget that.  It would be great to be able to intercept key/mouse events
    and direct them, though.

  - Event tap?
      https://encyclopediaofdaniel.com/blog/os-x-event-tap/
      https://developer.apple.com/reference/coregraphics/quartz_event_services
    Hmm, looks like it's either Swift or Objective-C?  Not applescript.
  - Possibly relevant stuff about event architecture, with diagram:

  - Seems like this goes into the too hard pile :-(
