Q: how to get curl to work around here? (ILM)
A:
    The proxy is proxy.lucasfilm.com:8080 .
    So,
        setenv http_proxy proxy.lucasfilm.com:8080
        setenv https_proxy proxy.lucasfilm.com:8080
    I think that applies to both wget and perl.
    Then, could use --proxy-user dhatch --proxy-passwd 'MY_PASSWORD_HERE' http://google.com/,
    but don't want that showing up in the process table, so instead,
    put this in my ~/.wgetrc (and chmod 600 it):
           proxy-user = dhatch
           proxy-passwd = MY_PASSWORD_HERE
           http-user = my_website_username_here
           http-passwd = MY_WEBSITE_PASSWORD_HERE
    For using curl, put this in my ~/.curlrc (and chmod 600 it):
           proxy-user = dhatch:MY_PASSWORD_HERE
           user = my_website_username_here:MY_WEBSITE_PASSWORD_HERE
