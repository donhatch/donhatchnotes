The following are getting me down:
  - click-to-type, and can't interact with a non-topmost window, on mac;
    point-to-type less and less supported even though it leads to better
    productivity
  - scroll bars on the right
  - scroll bars that snap back when I drift too far away from them
  - those crappy scroll bars on ubuntu desktop
  - 1-pixel-wide window borders
  - no usable workflow for file merging exists any more
    - I miss xxdiff-- all alternatives are confusing and can't see what
      I'm doing or keep my bearings easily
  - git log can't do swimlanes because it doesn't remember what branch
      you checked things in on
  - google thinks one shoe fits all people all the time for all tasks
