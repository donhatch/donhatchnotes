NOTE: a lot of this is applicable to more general linux/gnome/cinnamon,
even though I'm not using ubuntu any more.
See ./cinnamon-applets for notes on that.

Q: screen magnifier? (have xmag, continuous would be better)
A: kmag
    and click on Mouse (not sure what weird state it was in before)
    settings -> Stays on top -> off
    argh! turned off menu bar, how do I get it back?
        well, can edit ~/.kde/share/config/kmagrc
        and change MenuBar=Disabled to MenuBar=Enabled (in 2 places)
        or just remove the file

Q: in kmag (or something else?) how to see rgb of current pixel?
A: gpick's eyedropper shows nice mag window with continous rgb,
   it seems to be the only tool I know of that does.  None of the magnifiers do.
   (see nonwork/colorchoosers)



Q: gamma?
A: xgamma
   xgamma -?
   xgamma -gamma 1.2 or whatever

Q: how do I install things?
   can I just run yum install or something?
   (not sure what equivalent is on ubuntu)
PA: sudo apt-get install <package name>
    or sudo apt install <package name>    (maybe same thing but doesn't prompt?)
    and, there's something called ineptitude?
    not sure if that's just a front-end for apt-get or what

Q: how do I tell what's installed? it's not rpm evidently
    dpkg-query?
    apt?
A: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/linux/show-the-list-of-installed-packages-on-ubuntu-or-debian/
   To list installed packages:
       dpkg --get-selections
           huh? it doesn't list qgis?
Q: how do I list what files are in an installed package?
A: dpkg -L perl
Q: how do I tell what installed package a file came from?
A: dpkg -S /usr/bin/perl

Q: acroread?
    hmm, I "ineptitude"d it, but it's not showing up in dpkg...
    oh, I guess the package doesn't exist... gives the same output
    if I type garbage.


Q: graphical diff?
A: tkdiff
   also, sudo apt-get install xxdiff.
   see ./difftools

Q: xmouse (focus-follows-mouse)?
A: ccsm (Compiz Config Settings Manager)
       -> General Options
       -> Focus & Raise Behavior
           turn off click to focus
           turn off raise on click
           turn off auto-raise
           leave focus prevention level low
    Q: there's a delay before focus, so often when I move mouse to a window and hit F1
       it's not recieved in the desired window.
       Is the delay intentional, and if so, can I get rid of it?
    PA: probably not intentional since it's so varying...
        also went away when I rebooted
    Q: now windows don't raise even if I click on them, which is great...
       but they don't raise even when clicked in the title bar or border!
       can I make them get raised in that case?
    PA:
        dconf-editor
            org/gnome/desktop/wm/preferences
                focus-mode sloppy (was "click" before even though I set it to sloppy using ccsm)
                auto-raise leave off
                raise-on-click on->off
        seems to work for the gnome-terminal windows but not for chrome? bleah!
            raise-on-click off:
                click in gnome-terminal titlebar: raise
                click in gnome-terminal: no raise
                click in chrome titlebar: no raise
                click in chrome: no raise
            raise-on-click on:
                click anywhere: raise

Q: how do I make the default terminal font smaller?
   my preferred terminal font size is what I get from one ctrl-minus.
PA: rightclick on terminal background -> Profile Preferences
    uncheck "use the system fixed width font"
    (makes everything bigger, but now I can select. default is Monospace 12;
    11 looks like the original,
    10 seems to be what I want)

Q: I don't like the speed bump between the screens. how do I get rid of it?
PA: run ccsm
       Ubuntu Unity Plugin -> Experimental -> Launcher Edge Stop Overcome Pressure
               change from 20 to 1 (0 isn't allowed apparently)
           Edge Stop Velocity
               change from 65 to 1
   still not perfect but better :-(
   why the hell can't I change it to 0??
A: get rid of the center launcher panel, it's an eyesore anyway:
    settings / Displays
      changed Launcher Placement from "All Displays" to just the left one

Q: I hate the sticky windows that stick to screen boundaries.  how do I get
   rid of it?
A: settings gear -> System Settings -> Displays -> Sticky edges OFF!
   WOOHOO! that fixed the previous speed bump issue too!
   But weeks later, the problem is back, and this fix doesn't fix it
   any more :-(
   oh wait maybe it's called "window snapping"
   there are a couple of suggestions here: http://askubuntu.com/questions/105028/force-disable-snapping-windows . namely,
   under ccsm's "Window Management":
       - disable "Snapping Windows" (this seems to be the one that does it!)
       - disable "Place Windows" (no don't! if it's not on, windows appear in a really inconvenient place)
       - disable "Scale" (but it says it's needed by Ubuntu Unity Plugin so I kept it on)

Q: I hate the automatic blow-window-up-to-full-screen when I accidentally
   bump into the screen side edge. how do I get rid of it?

Q: system/cpu load monitor applet for the unity plugin thing?
PA: sudo apt-get install indicator-multiload
    just run it from command line? hmm

Q: how to add/delete/change things on the launcher panel and the top panel?

Q: is the desktop workspace switcher any more configurable than I can see? (shortcuts? more desktops? quicker switching?)
A: http://www.howtogeek.com/113330/
       ctrl-alt-arrow to switch workspaces
       ctrl-alt-shift-arrow to swtich workspaces bringing the focused window with you
   Q: more workspaces?
   A: ccsm (Compiz Config Settings Manager)
          -> General Options
          -> Desktop Size
      or:
        gconftool-2 --type=int --set /apps/compiz-1/general/screen0/options/vsize 4
        gconftool-2 --type=int --set /apps/compiz-1/general/screen0/options/hsize 4
   Q: can I tell what workspace I'm in at a glance? either make icon smarter,
      or mess with background to make it obvious?
   PA: to get wallpaper plugin: sudo apt-get install compiz-fusion-plugins-extra
       ccsm -> Utility -> Wallpaper
       doesn't seem to do anything??
       some sources say I need to disable in gconf-editor: apps->nautilus->preferences->show_desktop, but there's no such variable??
       it just shows the image I set in right-click-on-background -> change desktop background

       whoa wait! this: http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/linux-and-open-source/tweak-ubuntu-unity-get-a-dock-style-launcher-and-unity-dash/
       has a comment saying "And if you install Compiz Config Settings Manager you can set up different wallpapers for each workspace."
       that's ccsm... bleah! I guess it doesn't work?
       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSqDk3I6v8c
       says ccsm -> Wallpaper
       but it's not working?
       OH then it says:
        sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool
        gnome-tweak-tool
            Desktop
                Have file manager handle the desktop: ON->OFF
       YES!
       Then added images... "Scaled" instead of "Scale and crop"

       weird, after rebooting and logging in again,
       the wallpaper didn't appear...
       but as soon as I made any edit to the list of wallpapers to use,
       it appeared??
       i.e. ccsm -> Utility -> Wallpaper
            change something from "scale and crop" to "scale" and back
            suddenly they all appear
    PA: possibilities for changing the icon:
            http://askubuntu.com/questions/80627/how-can-i-change-the-icon-of-an-application-in-the-unity-launcher
            http://askubuntu.com/questions/43278/how-to-change-the-new-workspace-icon-to-the-older-icon
            http://askubuntu.com/questions/42156/is-there-a-way-to-change-the-icon-of-a-running-application-on-the-gnome-panel
        the "how-to-change" one says:
            sudo mv /usr/share/icons/unity-icon-theme/apps/48/workspace-switcher.png{,.bak}
            sudo convert -background None /usr/share/icons/Humanity/apps/48/gnome-panel-workspace-switcher.svg /usr/share/icons/unity-icon-theme/apps/48/workspace-switcher.png
            sudo update-icon-caches /usr/share/icons/unity-icon-theme
            restart unity?  fuck :-(
            (unity &)
        maybe hook up something so when I switch desktops, it does that?
        someone says there's a better way than sudo, by setting something in /usr/share/applications ...
        but the link is broken :-(
        oh hell, restarting unity is WAY too intrusive! what the hell do I do?
        hey wait a minute, maybe add an applet to the top panel (similar to the cpu meter that's there?)
        is there a generic notification applet, whose icon I can change at will?
        WAIT a minute, look here:
            http://www.maketecheasier.com/15-useful-appindicator-applets-for-ubuntu/
        it says:
            sudo add-apt-repository ppa:geod/ppa-geod
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install indicator-workspaces
        hmm, I don't think I can do that... would need to check with someone.
        maybe this:

Q: F1 to raise window, F2 to lower?
A:  System Settings icon -> Hardware -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Windows
        Raise window above other windows: F1
        Lower window below other windows: F2
    (also avail via ccsm -> General Options -> Key bindings)
Q: show window size when resizing?
A: ccsm -> Utility -> check "Resize Info"


Q: keyboard shortcut to lock screen?

Q: turn off the damn magnetism ("sticky edges") between the two screens
   in a dual-monitor setup?
PA: https://askubuntu.com/questions/109338/how-do-i-disable-mouse-magnet-on-middle-edge-with-multi-monitors
    - Javier Rivera's answer didn't work because there's no such section "sticky edges" on my "Display" preference dialog
    - Jo-Erlend Schinstad's answer didn't work because there's no /apps/compiz-1
    - SirSid's answer didn't work because there's no "unity" in my ccsm
PA: https://askubuntu.com/questions/109338/how-do-i-disable-mouse-magnet-on-middle-edge-with-multi-monitors
    ccsm, filter by "edge"
    -> Window Management / Snapping Windows
        (it's turned off already, supposedly :-( )
        (but tried turning it on and turning off all features in it;
         i.e. unchecked Snap_Type:"edge resistance" and Edges:"screen edges"
         which were checked, and lowered the resistance & attraction
         distances from 30 to 1 and 20 to 1, respectively)
    (none of it had any effect :-( )
