There must be a conspiracy or something;
I've wasted days trying to look up how to manage plug-ins,
with no success.
You can view the current plug-ins:
        Help -> About Plug-ins
The links it shows for more information are either broken or useless.

Here is purportedly an mplayer plug-in:

Oh my god, it worked!

    Q: how to clear the URL entry field without losing clipboard contents?
    A: ctrl-L backspace, or esc backspace
       or, ctrl-shift-L (same as File->Open URL) and paste there instead
       or, just paste into an empty area in the browser canvas!
       or (more legit) paste onto the bookmark icon to left of url
       or, note that select-to-copy, middle-to-paste uses PRIMARY
           whereas ctrl-c,ctrl-v uses CLIPBOARD...
           so, use the ctrl-c,ctrl-v thing.  except I don't
           know how to get stuff from gnome-terminal into CLIPBOARD,
           so it just doesn't work as a general solution.
