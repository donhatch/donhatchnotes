Here is a brain dump of all the relevant common uses of high/low level I can think of at the moment.

high=coarse, low=fine
---------------------
- pyramid (apex at top)
- {high,low}-level explanation/details
- {high,low} viewing elevation
- systems that label the levels 0 finest, 1 next-coarser, etc.

high=fine, low=coarse
---------------------
- inverted pyramid (apex at bottom)
- {high,low} detail <-> {high,low} level-of-detail (LOD) <-> {high,low} level
- {high,low} resolution
- {up,down}-res
- {up,down}-sample
- {high,low}-frequency signal,  {high,low}-pass filter
- systems that label the levels 0 coarsest, 1 next-finer, etc.

It's interesting to note that, in some cases, a very minor difference in wording
completely flips the meaning.
The most dramatic case of this being:
  - high-level details   (sounds to me like it means coarse)
  - high level-of-detail  (sounds to me like it means fine)
