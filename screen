Q: how do I split a region and open a new bash shell in the new region?
A:   to split: ^a S or ^a |
     to navigate among panes: ^a tab,
        also useful to add bindings as suggested in man page:
            bind j focus down                 
            bind k focus up                   
            bind t focus top                  
            bind b focus bottom               
       XXX wait, that didn't work like I thought it would

     to "create a new window with a command prompt in this pane":
       ^a c

Q: if am split vertically, can I add
   another pane across the bottom?

Q: can't scroll using terminal window scroll bars or mouse,
   at least when ssh'ed in from mac to linux
A: http://slaptijack.com/system-administration/mac-os-x-terminal-and-gnu-screen-scrollback/
   says add this to .screenrc:
     defscrollback 5000
     termcapinfo xterm* ti@:te@


Q: I don't like that the primary command key is ^a since that conflicts with bash
   command line editing. What can I do?
A:
    ^a a sends ^a
    Or, can change it to, e.g. ^b, by putting this in ~/.screenrc:
    escape ^Bb
