Q: how to print debugging traces from cinnamon applets?  e.g. in ~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/workspace-grid@hernejj/GridStyle.js
A: 
  1. tail -f ~/.cinnamon/glass.log
     (per https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14025722/how-to-debug-cinnamon-applet#answer-28512708 )
     That shows stuff that you print from the javascript using:
       global.log("FOO");
  2. tail -f ~/.xsession-errors
     That shows some warnings from the javascript, e.g.:
       Cjs-Message: JS WARNING: [/usr/local/google/home/donhatch/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/workspace-grid@hernejj/BarIndicatorStyle.js 96]: anonymous function does not always return a value
       Cjs-Message: JS WARNING: [/usr/local/google/home/donhatch/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/workspace-grid@hernejj/GridStyle.js 81]: anonymous function does not always return a value
  3. If you restart cinnamon using `cinnamon --replace &`, then those messages will appear on that terminal instead.
      
   To reload: Remove from panel and Add to panel, using System Settings -> Preferences -> Applets 
Q: where is the javascript source for workspace-grid@hernjj and workspace-switcher@cinnamon.org?
A: 
  ~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/workspace-grid@hernejj/
  /usr/share/cinnamon/applets/workspace-switcher@cinnamon.org
So, to work on it, I would think:
  cp -a /usr/share/cinnamon/applets/workspace-switcher@cinnamon.org ~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/workspace-switcher-hacked/

Q: how to get the system to recognize a new applet that I've added to ~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/ ?
PA: Don't know the real way, but a hacky way
    is to just install any applet from `Available applets (online)`.
    That will refresh the list.
Q: but when I do that and Add the thing, it turns red without any indication
   of what went wrong??
A: Some gotchas:
   - uuid in metadata.json must match directory name!
   - workspace-grid@hernejj has 'workspace-grid@hernejj' hard-coded inside it, you have to change that every place it occurs
     except outright log messages.  If you don't, each place you mess it up will give an inscrutible error,
     e.g. "workspace-grid@hernejj Main Applet Exception: TypeError: xletDir is undefined"

Q: can I exit an applet instead of going off the rails?  throwing an Error doesn't seem to.
