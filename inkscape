Inkscape: really nice tool for editing svg's. Better than gimp for things
like annotating images with arrows and text.

QUESTIONS:
  Q: how to white out some of the area behind the text?
  Q: how to undo selecting? (undo only applies to editing, apparently)
  Q: how to tell what defaults I've modified?
  Q: factory reset?

=======================================================================
How to do some stuff:

  group: ctrl-G
  ungroup: ctrl-shift-G

  Create segments and turn them into arrows:
    F6 (or click on pencil tool) to draw line segments

    double-click on the pencil to get pencil prefs
      change to "Last used style"
      (not quite sure what semantica are)
      (unfortunately it remembers from last session!?)

    click,click;click,click  to draw segs
    F1 (or select tool) to select one of them
    Object/Fill_and_Stroke (or click on Stroke in lower-left)
      change color to ff3600ff
      change width to 3
      change Start Marker to Arrow2Mstart
      Extensions > Modify Path > Color Markers to Match Stroke.
    Once I have one, it's most efficent do just dup it (ctrl-d) and move endpoints.

  Connector tool / Edit segment endpoints:
    F2 or 'o' (or click on Edit Paths by Nodes tool)
    click on object to select it, then drag nodes. simple!

  Text:
    F8 (or text tool)
    click on 'T' in lower-right to change font properties,
      leave font "Sans"
      hmm I think 18 is thr right size, but it's a bit more wide spaced
    and apply and set as default.


  Drop shadows:
   select the object(s) (select tool / F1)
     ctrl-d (or ...) to duplicate it, that's the shadow (one for each selected obj)
       arrow keys to move it precisely, maybe 6 pixels south, to work with it
       bottom: shift-color and ctrl-color to change both interior/border color
         to 40% gray  (or maybe 20% gray and no blur)
       Object/Fill_and_Stroke...
         Blur: 1.0 (or not, if 20% gray)
       arrow keys to move it back precisely, maybe 1 pixel south of where it was originally.
       page-down/page-up to move it up/down in stacking order.
       Extensions > Modify Path > Color Markers to Match Stroke.
         (don't do this til end, because it destroys selection!)
         Q: is there a way to reselect?
         PA: I don't think so, but can group using ctrl-G

    if doing lots of them, do them in a group...
    but the very last operation has to be Ungroup and then Color Markers,
    since I don't think there's any way to recover from that.

  Undo history:
    Edit > Undo History
    note that the cursor is really *after* the selected item.
    Huh! I like the format! It's hierarchical...
      (it doesn't retain the whole history tree though...
       that is, an editing action clears the redo stack)

  Select multiple items:
    Esc to clear selection (failure to do this was messing me up for a while)
    shift-click to add to selection, or shift-drag to drag out bounding boxes

=======================================================================

Q: it keeps opening up in a weird position, what to do?
A: per http://www.inkscapeforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=20544:
   pan/zoom to where I'd like it to be, select an item, press an arrow,
   press opposite key to put it back, save, close.
