Options for scattered data interpolation:

Disclaimer: all implementations of scattered data interpolation,
especially in 3d, suck.  We will not be able to come up
with a scheme that works for all, or even most, needs,
so don't get your hopes up.  You WILL be unhappy with the result.


    - radial basis function
        Pros:
            - each sample has bounded footprint (that's a pro if that's what's desired)
        Cons:
            - simple implementation requires one global radius.
              If that's not adequate, trying to improve it at all
              becomes hellishly complicated.
            - each sample has bounded footprint (that's a con if that's not what's desired)
            - what is the RBF? what is the radius?
    - k nearest sample points, weighted by 1/dist or 1/dist^2
        Pros:
            - each sample has unbounded footprint (that's a pro if that's what's desired),
              becoming the average of all the samples in the limit
            - not tied to any particular distance
              (where samples are dense, it behaves the same, qualitatively,
              as where samples are sparse)
        Cons:
            - each sample has unbounded footprint (that's a con if that's not what's desired)
    - k nearest sample points, weighted by 1/dist or 1/dist^2, with distance cutoff
        Pros:
            - same pros as previous but with bounded footprint
        Cons:
            - footprint goes to zero discontinuously--
              that seems like a fatal error for a velocity field

    - some kind of voronoi weighting
        Cons: in 3d, too complicated to be feasible
