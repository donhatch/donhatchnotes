man rsync
a lot like "cp -a" but smart about copying only what's needed

Q: how to avoid creating a subdir when the destination already exists?
A:  The crucial thing to remember is:
    A trailing slash on the source
    means do *not* create an additional directory level at the destination.
    I.e. "copy the contents of this directory"
    as opposed to "copy the directory by name"...
    however, in both cases the *attributes* of the containing directory
    are copied.
    (If you don't want that, then use src/* instead of src/...
    in which case the destination must already exist, of course.)

Q: how to make it delete files from dst that have been deleted from src?
A: --delete
