On Linux/X:

  A good way to debug what's going on is to use "xclip -o" with one of various
  -sel options.
  Here's the story.

  xclip (from man page):
    -sel p[rimary] (default)
    -sel s[econdary]
    -sel c[lipboard]
  vim (from help):
    :help clipboard
    :help x11-selection
    :help x11-cut-buffer
    "* is PRIMARY
    "+ is CLIPBOARD
  gnome-terminal
    dragging out or double-clicking to select puts it into PRIMARY
    middle-clicking to paste gets it from PRIMARY
  chrome (and other gui apps, no doubt):
    selecting (or things like ctrl-a) puts it in PRIMARY
    ctrl-c copies selection to both PRIMARY (if someone stole it) and CLIPBOARD
    ctrl-v pastes from CLIPBOARD

    Note: single clicking on URL highlights/selects but doesn't
    put it anywhere! If you want it in primary, you have to either:
        - ctrl-a or triple-click to get it in PRIMARY
        - ctrl-c to get it in both PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD

  Possibly useful programs to have running:
    - klipper (seems to be broken on latest ubuntu)
    - glipper
    - parcellite


  great page on X clipboard (but maybe even more detail than I need?):

  Q: how the hell do I copy-paste from a terminal window into acroread??
     problem is copying from terminal window only puts it into PRIMARY
         (no access to CLIPBOARD I don't think)
     and acroread only pastes from CLIPBOARD
         (no access to PRIMARY I don't think).
  PA: klipper and parcellite have options for "synchronize contents
      of clipboard and selection", but they aren't great
      since they short-circuit the ctrl-c/ctrl-v functionality
      of programs like chrome.
  A: xclip -o -sel p | xclip -sel c
     Or use vim:
        - "+yy or whatever to yank into clipboard.
        - :let @+ = @*

  Q: copy something from a cmd or console2 on windows...
     can paste it back,
     but can NOT paste it into thunderbird on linux (through synergy).
     but, can paste it into gnome-terminal on linux (through synergy),
     then copy-paste it from there to thunderbird.  what the fuck??
     Really need to monitor what's happening to get a clear idea of how things work.
     TODO: revisit this using xclip to see what's going on


Q: (linux) when I've selected lots,
   how do I paste it?  the following methods suck:
    cat >> myfile, and paste
            prematurely eofs, giving lots of errors
    vim myfile, and paste
            takes a ridiculously long time... O(n^2)?
A: A couple of nice ways:
     - xclip:
         echo foo | xclip
         xclip -o > outfile
     - vim:
         "*p
         "+p


On Windows:
    Clipboard stack would be nice.
    People have suggested:
        ClipX
        Clipmate (not free)
        ClipBoard Diary
        clipmagic
        Ditto
        PureText (has "paste as unformatted)
        Yankee Clipper
        something using AutoHotKey
    A bunch of them described here: http://www.nonags.com/nonags/clipb.html

    But... do we really need a menu?
    How about just ctrl-v going back through the stack
    and something else going forward through it? hmm.
    no wait, ctrl-v ctrl-v ctrl-v pastes 3 times, so that doesn't work.

    How bout this:
        ctrl-v pastes and leaves nothing selected, as usual
        ctrl-shift-v pastes and leaves the pasted thing selected,
            so that ctrl-shift-v again can replace it with previous
            thing in clip history, etc.?
            and then should releasing shift make deselect?
    See this:
        http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/10576-a-simple-clipboard-stack-kill-ring/
        post on 24-March-2009 says he's tried almost every clipboard manager out there and very few allow this basic funcionality, and those who do implement it horribly.

    AutoHotKey-based:
        This page:
            http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/misc/Clipboard.htm
        lists a couple of ahk-based ones:
            Deluxe Clipboard
            ClipStep (note, the version here seems to work for me on vista;
                      the one on donationcoder.com has more menus and About
                      but doesn't seem to work (paste claims there's no clip)
                BUT interacts poorly with cygwin,
                in which ctrl-c and ctrl-v don't mean copy and paste!
                so, guess I can't use this?  :-(

On Mac:
  Generally cmd-c to copy and cmd-v to paste, cmd-x to cut.
  To view clipboard contents: Finder->Edit -> Show Clipboard
