On Windows:
    Clipboard stack would be nice.
    People have suggested:
        ClipX
        ClipBoard Diary
        clipmagic
        Ditto
        PureText (has "paste as unformatted)
        Yankee Clipper
        something using AutoHotKey
    A bunch of them described here: http://www.nonags.com/nonags/clipb.html

    But... do we really need a menu?
    How about just ctrl-v going back through the stack
    and something else going forward through it? hmm.
    no wait, ctrl-v ctrl-v ctrl-v pastes 3 times, so that doesn't work.

    How bout this:
        ctrl-v pastes and leaves nothing selected, as usual
        ctrl-shift-v pastes and leaves the pasted thing selected,
            so that ctrl-shift-v again can replace it with previous
            thing in clip history, etc.?
            and then should releasing shift make deselect?
    See this:

        post on 24-March-2009 says he's tried almost every clipboard manager out there and very few allow this basic funcionality, and those who do implement it horribly.

    AutoHotKey-based:
        This page:
            http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/misc/Clipboard.htm
        lists a couple of ahk-based ones:
            Deluxe Clipboard
            ClipStep (note, the version here seems to work for me on vista;
                      the one on donationcoder.com has more menus and About
                      but doesn't seem to work (paste claims there's no clip)
                BUT interacts poorly with cygwin,
                in which ctrl-c and ctrl-v don't mean copy and paste!
                so, guess I can't use this?  :-(

On Linux/X:


    great page on X clipboard:

    Still tons of mysteries.  I don't like not knowing what's going on.
    For example...

    Q: copy something from a cmd or console2 on windows...
       can paste it back,
       but can NOT paste it into thunderbird on linux (through synergy).
       but, can paste it into gnome-terminal on linux (through synergy),
       then copy-paste it from there to thunderbird.  what the fuck??
       Really need to monitor what's happening to get a clear idea of how things work.
