Still tons of mysteries.  I don't like not knowing what's going on.
For example...

Q: copy something from a cmd or console2 on windows...
   can paste it back,
   but can NOT paste it into thunderbird on linux (through synergy).
   but, can paste it into gnome-terminal on linux (through synergy),
   then copy-paste it from there to thunderbird.  what the fuck??
