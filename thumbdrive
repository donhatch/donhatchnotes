        To use the ThumbDrive on Linux do the following.

           1. Reboot your PC
           2. Login as root
           3. Plug in Thumbdrive Smart (the LED should light up)
           4. Open command console: Enter the command: "mkdir -p /mnt/trek ;mount -tvfat /dev/sda1 /mnt/trek"
    hey it works!  but not the usb ports in the front
    and it works with just:
        # mount  /dev/sda1 /mnt/trek
