Tools for figuring it out:
  - tput (described in the how-to-change-the-output-color-of-echo-in-linux page)
      (bleah, seems to be lacking)
  - scriptecho is supposed to be good, haven't installed it
  - colortest package:
      colortest-8
      colortest-16
      colortest-16b <-- ooh this one is very useful! shows escape sequences!
                        what it doesn't say is, to get back to normal:
                        ESC[0m
                        hmm actually I'm having trouble getting any useful
                        info out of it.
      colortest-256



echo "$(tput setaf 1)Hello, world$(tput sgr0)"
