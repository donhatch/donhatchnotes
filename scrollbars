Q: is there a way to disable the snap, or make the "hotspot" ("drag region") bigger?
   (ideally covering whole screen except for 1 pixel wide on left or something? hmm)

PA:  Make an AutoHotKey script... unfortunately it only recognizes native "Scrollbar" controls...
     some programs use them, others (firefox, chrome) don't,
     and the scroll bars aren't really recognizeable. :-(


Scroll bars are better on the left.
Assumptions:
    - scrolling does *not* cause window to be raised or lowered
    - in fact, clicking in a window (to do selections and stuff) does *not* cause window to be raised or lowered
Reason: you can be monitoring 10 different overlapping windows,
each with just the lower-left (most important)
part visible, and be able to scroll each one.
