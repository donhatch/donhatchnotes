Q: How to move and resize X11 windows from the command line?
   I used to have a command xmoveresizewindow,
   which was just a CLI for XMoveResizeWindow.

   But then it became possible to do it using standard tools, e.g.
     xdotool
     wmctrl

   But, now those tools stopped working (ubuntu / cinnamon).

   Furthermore, I don't know whether to expect that XMoveResizeWindow
   still works or not; see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56407459/xlib-two-issues-with-call-to-xmoveresizewindow.

   Note a complication: there is not a $WINDOWID variable
   in gnome-terminal like there is in xterm and konsole :-(
   So the only way I know to get a window id is `xwininfo` and click on it.

PA:
  Trying wmctrl:   g,x,y,w,h
    Note that all windows seem to have gravity NorthWestGravity,
    which is 1.

    wmctrl -r 0x5ec3322 -e 1,0,0,500,500
      Does nothing :-(
    wmctrl -v -r 0x5ec3322 -e 1,0,0,500,500

    :-(

  Trying xdotool:

    xdotool getactivewindow windowmove 0 0

    Hey, that does something!
    Hmm, it's relative to the current physical screen (right half of logical screen)
    And if I move the upper-left corner of the window to the other screen,
    I lose the window forever :-(
    Trying to retrieve it:
      xdotool windowmove 0x05ebe693 2000 200
    It's being flaky and inscrutible :-(
    I can see the icon for it in the desktop panel, and it moves around,
    sort of, but I can no longer get to it.
    Oh! I can get to it by maximizing and then restoring.  Hmm.
    Oh! values other than 0 do the logical screen!  That's weird!
    Actually the criterion seems to be:
      y <= 20: physical screen
      y >= 21: logical screen

    Also maybe useful:
      xdotool getactivewindow windowmove --relative 1 1
    argh! that moves by a huge amount: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53356562/wmctrl-xdotool-move-all-windows-by-just-1px
    oh hmm, actuall doing it absolute gets it wrong by that much too.
    I think it's wrong by the amount of window decoration:
    it drifts by +11+60 each time.

Q: Ok, now that I can sort of control window positions using xdotool,
   can I recover from this annoying state I get into sometimes,
   in which the displays go back to mirrored, and when I fix it in prefs,
   all the windows have moved over to the left (laptop) phys screen,
   when I want them all on the right (external monitor) one?

PA:
                 +-----------+
     +-----------+           |
     | 1920x1080 | 2560x1440 |
     +-----------+-----------+
   And logical size is 4480x1440:
     xdotool getdisplaygeometry
       2560 1440

   I think I have to list all the positions first,
   and then, for any whose left side corner seems to be on the left screen,
   just move it over to the right by the size of that screen (1920).
   For reference, the sizes are:

   To list windows:
     wmctrl -l

   To list only gnome-terminal or chrome windows:
     xdotool search -class gnome-terminal
     xdotool search -class chrome
   but why doesn't this work??
     xdotool search --any --class gnome-terminal --class chrome
   I guess I don't understand xdotool :-(
   There is something from the author here that I don't understand:

   To get current geometry:
     xwininfo -id 0x5ec3322
	xwininfo: Window id: 0x5ec3322 "  donhatch@donhatch-glaptop2: ~"

	  Absolute upper-left X:  1982
	  Absolute upper-left Y:  285
	  Relative upper-left X:  10
	  Relative upper-left Y:  34
	  Width: 494
	  Height: 561
	  Depth: 24
	  Visual: 0x5ab
	  Visual Class: TrueColor
	  Border width: 0
	  Class: InputOutput
	  Colormap: 0x5e00005 (installed)
	  Bit Gravity State: NorthWestGravity
	  Window Gravity State: NorthWestGravity
	  Backing Store State: NotUseful
	  Save Under State: no
	  Map State: IsViewable
	  Override Redirect State: no
	  Corners:  +1982+285  -2004+285  -2004-594  +1982-594
	  -geometry 80x43+1972+251

     xdotool getwindowgeometry 0x5ec3322
     xdotool search -class gnome-terminal getwindowgeometry %@

  Can get whole tree as: xwininfo -root -tree
  but that's too many, I don't want to move children.
  I guess I want to move only things that are immediate children of the root?

  And, need to be careful to move parent, not child, of frame vs internal window.

  Ok let's keep it simple for starters, and move only gnome-terminal windows
  and chrome windows.

  windowids=$(xdotool search --class gnome-terminal; xdotool search -class chrome)
  for windowid in $windowids; do
    echo $windowid; (
      eval $(xdotool getwindowgeometry --shell $windowid);
      echo windowid=$windowid: WINDOW X=$X Y=$Y;
      if (($X < 1920)); then
        echo xdotool windowmove $windowid $(($X - 11 + 1920)) $(($Y - 60));
             xdotool windowmove $windowid $(($X - 11 + 1920)) $(($Y - 60));
      fi
    );
  done

  Holy moly, it worked!!
