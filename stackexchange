Q: how to view the markdown source to a question or answer?
A: 
   hack: edit even if no intent to edit (doesn't work on meta for some answers, no permission to suggest edits)
   hack: *if* an edit has been made, follow edit history to "raw source" for that revision
   Real answers, linked here (including completely obscure backdoor
   for when question hasn't been edited)
