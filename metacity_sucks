I'd like to redo the window manager keyboard focus policy.
What kinds of things happen?

(1) mouse moves:
      upper window to lower window (was in lower window the whole time)
        SWITCH TO NEW WINDOW
      lower window to upper window (still in lower window)
        SWITCH TO NEW WINDOW
      root to window
        SWITCH TO NEW WINDOW
      window to root
        depending on preference, either no focus change
            or switch to no focus
      window to adjacent window
        SWITCH TO NEW WINDOW
      move within upper window when focus was lower window
        SWITCH TO UPPER WINDOW
    summary: any mouse movement over a window
        should switch to the topmost window
(2) non mouse moves:
      window raised under the mouse
        NO FOCUS CHANGE unless initiated by user
      window lowered under the mouse
        NO FOCUS CHANGE unless initiated by user
      window appeared under the mouse, from root
        NO FOCUS CHANGE
      window appeared under the mouse, from another window
        NO FOCUS CHANGE
      window disappeared under the mouse, to root
        SWITCH TO NO FOCUS  (so no other window recieves keystrokes)
      window disappeared under the mouse, to another window
        SWITCH TO NO FOCUS  (so final window doesn't recieve keystrokes)
   summary: if the mouse doesn't move, don't change the focus!
        unless the focused window disappears or moves out from
        under the mouse, in which case switch to NO FOCUS
        so that no other window gets the end of a sentence being typed



So the policy is as follows:
    Keyboard focus change occurs when one of two things happens:
        1) Mouse moves to a position that's in a window
           that doesn't already have focus:
            SWITCH FOCUS TO TOPMOST WINDOW
        3) User-initiated window push or pop or destroy
            (BUT NOT CREATE, SINCE THAT IS TIME DELAYED)
            resulting in a topmost window under the cursor
            that didn't previously have focus:
            SWITCH FOCUS TO TOPMOST WINDOW
        2) Non-user-initiated,
           the focus window disappears, is iconified, or moves out
           from under the mouse
            SWITCH FOCUS TO NO FOCUS
No other actions change focus.  In particular,
the focus is NOT changed by:
    - a new window popping up, in front of cursor or otherwise
