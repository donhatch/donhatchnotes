Subject: to make google docs comments wider in chrome

Ralf was saying that when viewing a google doc on a wide screen,
it would be nicer if the comments were wider.
Here is one way to make that happen:

    1. Install the "Stylish" extension from chrome.google.com/webstore
    2. Click on the Stylish extension icon -> Manage Installed Styles
        click "Write new style" button
            Name: wider comments in google docs
            Enabled: (check the box)
            Code: .docos-anchoreddocoview-facelift {width: 700px;}
            Applies to URLs starting with: https://docs.google.com/
            Save
    3. See how it looks, and tweak the 700px to your liking. (default is 240px)

Wish list for further improvements:
    * left-justify the document,
      to use up all that blank space on the left
      so there will be even more comment space on the right.
      The only method I've found for doing this
      is to change the "left" value to 0px in the following:
          <div class="kix-zoomdocumentplugin-outer" aria-hidden="true" style="width: 818px; height: 7462px; left: 434px; top: 8px;">
      Unfortunately this gets changed back by some javascript
      somewhere each time I resize the browser window,
      and I don't know how to disable or override that.

Trying to figure out how to do better...
I think it would be via a user script (formerly known as greasemonky script),
which you just call <scriptname>.user.js and drag it into chrome://extensions.
(actually that's disabled-- but can download it and drag from the download to there)
Okay so what should the .user.js file look like?
      // ==UserScript==
      // @name           SomeGoogleDocsTweaks
      // @description    Some google docs tweaks
      // @include        https://*
      // @version        1.0
      // ==/UserScript==

      alert(0);
Once I've got it installed,
can work directly in the extension directory.
Find it down inside ~/.config/google-chrome-beta/Default/Extensions;
it will be the most recently created one.
Mine ended up in:
There will be a file called script.js in there; edit that one.
Mine ended up in:
    ~/.config/google-chrome-beta/./Default/Extensions/hebjjhggeiakbnklplmbbpnegbmmegkn/1.0_0/script.js
Edit it, then
Disable/enable the extension to reload it.

Q: seems to work when loading https://plunk.org, but not http://plunk.org... ??
A: OH maybe I have javascript disabled altogether for http pages?
   hmm, settings -> advanced settings -> privacy -> content settings -> javascript
   says it's allowed on all sites... ?
