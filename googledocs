Subject: to make google docs comments wider in chrome

Ralf was saying that when viewing a google doc on a wide screen,
it would be nicer if the comments were wider.
Here is one way to make that happen:

    1. Install the "Stylish" extension from chrome.google.com/webstore
    2. Click on the Stylish extension icon -> Manage Installed Styles
        click "Write new style" button
            Name: wider comments in google docs
            Enabled: (check the box)
            Code: .docos-anchoreddocoview-facelift {width: 700px;}
            Applies to URLs starting with: https://docs.google.com/
            Save
    3. See how it looks, and tweak the 700px to your liking. (default is 240px)

Wish list for further improvements:
    * left-justify the document,
      to use up all that blank space on the left
      so there will be even more comment space on the right.
      The only method I've found for doing this
      is to change the "left" value to 0px in the following:
          <div class="kix-zoomdocumentplugin-outer" aria-hidden="true" style="width: 818px; height: 7462px; left: 434px; top: 8px;">
      Unfortunately this gets changed back by some javascript
      somewhere each time I resize the browser window,
      and I don't know how to disable or override that.

Trying to figure out how to do better...
I think it would be via a user script (formerly known as greasemonky script),
which you just call <scriptname>.user.js and drag it into chrome://extensions.
(actually that's disabled-- but can download it and drag from the download to there)
Okay so what should the .user.js file look like?
      // ==UserScript==
      // @name           SomeGoogleDocsTweaks
      // @description    Some google docs tweaks
      // @include        https://*
      // @version        1.0
      // ==/UserScript==

      alert(0);
Once I've got it installed,
can work directly in the extension directory.
Find it down inside ~/.config/google-chrome-beta/Default/Extensions;
it will be the most recently created one.
Mine ended up in:
There will be a file called script.js in there; edit that one.
Mine ended up in:
    ~/.config/google-chrome-beta/./Default/Extensions/hebjjhggeiakbnklplmbbpnegbmmegkn/1.0_0/script.js
Edit it, then
Disable/enable the extension to reload it.

Q: seems to work when loading https://plunk.org, but not http://plunk.org... ??
A: OH maybe I have javascript disabled altogether for http pages?
   hmm, settings -> advanced settings -> privacy -> content settings -> javascript
   says it's allowed on all sites... ?


Q: how do I create a brand new doc??
A: + button in lower right of docs.google.com page

Q: how do I put multiple paragraphs in a bullet point?
A: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2UhdpozSdQ
   HOLD DOWN THE SHIFT KEY while hitting Enter!

Q: How do I do the following:
        1. one one one stuff
            a. aaaaaaa stuff
            b. bbbbbb stuff
           more one stuff
           even more one stuff
        2. two stuff! yeah!
PA:
   I don't know how to do it in order.  But here's a way,
   inserting the sub-list last:
   - type "1. " to start first list (or click "Numbered list" icon from top menu bar).
   - type "one one one stuff<shift-enter>"; goes to next line without new number.
   - type "more one stuff<enter>"; goes to next line without new number
   - type "even more one stuff<enter>"; goes to next line with "2."
   - type "two stuff! yeah!"
   - mouse click at end of first line, hit <enter> there. "2." appears.
   - hit <tab>; "2." turns into right-shifted "a." (good) and the next two lines shift right (bad).
   - type "aaaaaa stuff<enter>bbbbb stuff"
   - click just before beginning of next line
   - type backspace (joins with previous line)
   - type enter; "c." appears.
   - type backspace; "c." disappears and the two lines move over to the left,
     as desired.
   - done!

  Another way, insert the stuff after the sub-list last:
   - type "1. " to start first list (or click "Numbered list" icon from top menu bar).
   - type "one one one stuff<enter>"; "2." appears.
   - type tab; "2." turns into further-indented "a."
   - type "aaaaaa stuff<enter>"; "b." appears.
   - type "bbbbb stuff<enter>"; "c." appears.
   - type shift-tab, "c." shifts left and turns into "2."
   - type "two stuff! yeah!"
   - click at end of the "b." line
   - type <enter>, "c." appears.
   - type <backspace>, "c." disappears and cursor moves over to left, as desired.
   - type "more one stuff"
   - type <enter> or <shift enter>, doesn't seem to matter which  (this is weird)
   - type "even more one stuff"
   - done!

  Ok let's try it in order (this doesn't work, but...)
   - type "1. " to start first list (or click "Numbered list" icon from top menu bar).
   - type "one one one stuff<enter>"; "2." appears.
   - type tab; "2." turns into further-indented "a."
   - type "aaaaaa stuff<enter>"; "b." appears.
   - type "bbbbb stuff<enter>"; "c." appears.
   - type backspace; the c. disappears and cursor goes back to where I want
   - type "more one stuff<shift-enter>"; goes to next line without new number
   - type "even more one stuff<enter>"; WOOPS! I want a "2." on next line, but there is none?

Q: I've got the following:
        1. 111111
           a. aaaaa
           b. bbbbb
        2. 2222222
           a. aaaaa
           b. bbbbb
   How do I change the first a.b. list to bullets,
   but not the second one?

PA: Use what I learned from the previous failed exercise:
   - type "1. 111111<enter>"
   - type tab
   - type "aaaaa<enter>bbbbb<enter>
   - type <backspace>
   - type "DUMMY<enter>"
   - type "<backspace>1. "
   - Format -> Bullets & Numbering -> List Options -> Restart Numbering ... Restart numbering at: "2"
   - delete the "DUMMY"
   - click to get cursor after the 2, then type the remainder: "22222<enter><tab>aaaaa<enter>bbbbb" then the two sub-lists won't be associated with each other.
     not ideal since the 2. isn't really associated with the 1. any more.

Q: how to subscribe to changes in a doc?
PA: for notification about comments:  open `comments thread` (floating button) -> Notifications -> All.
    I don't think there's any way to subscribe to changes.
