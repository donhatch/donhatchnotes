To unpack source and apply any patches...

    # rpm -Uvh dasher-3.2.15-1.src.rpm
    (to just prep)
        # rpmbuild -bp /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/dasher.spec
    (to prep and build)
        # rpmbuild -bc /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/dasher.spec
    (to prep and build and install)
        # rpmbuild -bi /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/dasher.spec
    (to prep and build and install and build binary package)
        # rpmbuild -bb /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/dasher.spec
    (to prep and build and install and build binary and source packages)
        # rpmbuild -ba /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/dasher.spec
    (to build just the source package, don't know what else it does
        # rpmbuild -bs /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/dasher.spec

The source code will end up down in /usr/src/redhat/BUILD .
(or /usr/src/packages/BUILD if not on redhat).


There seems to be a good doc here, if I want to get serious:
    http://fedoranews.org/hoyt/rpm/
it shows how to do this stuff as non-root, I think.
Also, focusing on glibc:
    http://devpit.org/wiki/Gnu_Toolchain/GLIBC/Building_GLIBC


Q: how to just unpack the source into a directory, without being root,
and look at it??
A: rpm2cpio I think
   no, look at: http://bradthemad.org/tech/notes/patching_rpms.php
