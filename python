            It's easy to make other objects == None, by writing buggy __eq__
            methods.  That doesn't happen much, but it's easier with __ne__, where
            the negated logic is easy to screw up.  I've seen it happen. Use "is
            None", not "== None".

            Because there surely are still libraries out there that return 0 and 1
            as true/false values. The bool type was introduced in (by memory)
            Python 2.2 or 2.3, so very old code may fail, or worse, silently do the
            wrong thing if you use "is True". 

GOTCHAS:
    - --x does not increment x !!!  it returns -(-x)). Likewise for ++x, etc.
      Need to use x-=1 and x+=1 instead, and there's no equivailent of
      post-increment or post-decrement.  Attempting them will usually
      give an error, except in cases like x++ - y which is treated
      as x + (+(-(y)). :-(

    - x = 3; print("x =", x)
      prints the list stringified, with parens and comma
      (although print("x") doesn't print the parens).
      Weird.  Need to omit the parens from the call, I guess.

    - a global variable can be looked at, or its elements assigned to,
      in a function, but the variable itself can't be assigned to
      unless you say "global x".  Without that, it will create
      a local variable and assign to it instead. :-(
      Also got bit by the following:
      in my main body (which is just statements in global scope),
      I created some variables, which became global...
      then I referred to that name by accident in a function,
      and it saw them instead of giving an error like I would
      have liked...  from now on I'm going to make an explicit main()
      to prevent this.

    - evidently semantics will be changing
      so that division is by default float division;
      see the -Q option in the man page.
      Use // for integer division (or divmod to get both quotient and remainder).
      (The Beazley book doesn't mention this.)

    - string functions that test for "is all something"
      return false on empty string-- lame!
      Is there a good workaround other than writing my own replacement?
      (see http://p-nand-q.com/python/stupid_lambda_tricks.html
      for an approach to a similar issue for list functions
      that sometimes return None)

    - bizarre symlink behavior when importing-- follows the symlink
      and looks for the imported files there.

    - Generator functions are NOT "tuple comprehension"!
      E.g.
          (10**i for i in xrange(3))
      behaves differently from
          [10**i for i in xrange(3)]
      as follows:
          >>>foo = [10**i for i in xrange(3)]
          >>> print [x for x in foo]
          [1, 10, 100]
          >>> print [x for x in foo]
          [1, 10, 100]
          >>> print [x for x in foo]
          [1, 10, 100]

          >>> bar = (10**i for i in xrange(3))
          >>> print [x for x in bar]
          [1, 10, 100]
          >>> print [x for x in bar]
          []
          >>> print [x for x in bar]
          []
       XXX give example from work
      

    - XXX MERGE THE FOLLOWING TWO GRIPES
        - lambda contexts don't work sanely, apparently.
            >>> print [f() for f in [lambda:range(n) for n in range(4)]]
            [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]]
            funlist = []
            for i in [0,1,2]:
                funlist.append(lambda:i)
            funlist[0](), funlist[1](), funlist[2]()
            (2,2,2)
            This page discusses the same thing:
                http://www.enricozini.org/2007/tips/python-scoping.html
            Oh!  And it gives a trick for solving it!
                print [f() for f in [lambda n=n:range(n) for n in range(4)]]
            similarly for the other one.

        - lambda scopes are broken:
            >> fs = [(lambda n: i + n) for i in range(10)]
            >> [f(4) for f in fs]
            [13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13]
          workaround:
            >> fs = [(lambda n,i=i: i + n) for i in range(10)]
            >> [f(4) for f in fs]
            [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
          see:
              http://math.andrej.com/2009/04/09/pythons-lambda-is-broken/

    - 1==True and 13==True evaluate to False, but
      bool(1)==True and bool(13)==True evaluate to True


     

THINGS I DIDN'T SEE AT FIRST:
    - for ... else   what a waste of my time having to research what this means
    - try ... else   what a waste of my time having to research what this means
    - reduce() has an optional "initial" parameter... so it's
      not zero-phobic after all!
      e.g. print reduce(lambda s,x: s+" %d"%x, [0,1,2], "foo:")
      This makes it much more useful!
      Although it would be even more useful, maybe, if
      it had an optional special-case-for-only-one-item parameter too...
    - == is deep, "is" is shallow (pointer compare)
        but wait: a = 1+1; b = 2; a is b
        returns True??? Then I don't understand what "is" means.

    - from http://www.norvig.com/python-iaq.html but without the trailing " ":
            import sys
            def printf(format, *args): sys.stdout.write(format%args)
TRICKS:
    - from http://www.norvig.com/python-iaq.html:
      To avoid typing quotes around key names:
            def Dict(**dict): return dict
            Dict(a=1, b=2, c=3, dee=4)
            {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c': 3, 'dee': 4}
      and there's a similar thing for objects.
    - to get a local variable inside a lambda, use a helper lambda inside,
       which declares the desired variable as a param with default value.
       From http://p-nand-q.com/python/stupid_lambda_tricks.html:
           f = lambda x: (lambda result=range(20):do_something(result,x))()
           As mentioned above, local variables are best used in a list,
           because that way you can use [].__setitem__ for data assignments.
       (what the hell did the last sentence mean?)
    - for key, value in os.environ.iteritems():


TO EXPERIMENT WITH:
    - generator functions: see http://www.secnetix.de/~olli/Python/examples.hawk
      I don't think this is mentioned in the Beazley book at all!
    - hmm! all standard types (string, integer) are classes and so can be
      sublassed?
    - http://www.secnetix.de/~olli/Python/dynamic_typing.hawk mentions
      doctest module for automated regression tests?
    - need to get good at regular expressions stuff
    - try to find another example where a "finally" will fail to execute--
      (stack overflow inside nested finallies, or something)
    - see whether can implement olli's incrementor (returning
      a function with a nested scope) using a local function definition
      instead of a lambda-- potentially more versatile.
    - see whether olli's example of parsing command line options:
        http://www.secnetix.de/~olli/Python/tricks.hawk
      is worthwhile
    - read up on semantics of shallow versus deep copying, p.21 and p.108
    - experiment with the bisection module:
        http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-bisect.html
      mentioned in the iaq
    - experiment with, and understand, the iaq's version
      of ternary ?:
    - try the iaq guy's .python startup file
FEATURES TO KEEP IN MIND:
    - time.clock()
    - documentation strings (if first statement of a
      module, class, or function is a string)
    - string concatenation by just putting the strings side-by-side
    - to undefine a variable, use del
    - can do singleton pattern, see the iaq. (note,
      it uses a totally non-obvious semantic of default args)
      


QUESTIONS (most recent first):
    Q: beazley p.16 it says "s1" u "s2" can be different from u"s1s2" ...
       what's an example of this? (It says details in Ch.4 and Appendix A)
    Q: beazley p.16 says raw strings can't end in a single backslash--
       why, for heaven's sake?? Backslashes aren't even treated specially,
       otherwise!

    Q: what are the utilities for converting an arg list
       to a properly quoted shell command, and back?
    A: shlex.split

    Q: how to tell whether an object is (derived from) a given class?
       (something like isa or instanceof)
    A: isinstance(obj,class)

    Q: how to tell what version of python is running a script?
    A: sys.version_info


    Q: how to tell whether a script was imported or execfile'ed,
       vs. being run from the command line?
    A: if __name__ == '__main__':
           # Running as a script

    Q: how to undefine a variable?
    A: del var0,var1,var2

    Q: how to test whether a certain variable exists?
    A: try:
           x
       except NameError:
           ... x doesn't exist, do something ...
       else:
           ... x exists, do something else ...

    Q: how to access the command name? (for usage message, for example)
    A: os.path.basename(sys.argv[0])

    Q: the iaq says the lack of "new" keyword is a good thing-- I don't
       understand this yet.
    Q: "==" (deep compare, as opposed to "is" which is pointer compare)--
       are these overrideable in classes?
    Q: what are the semantics of shallow versus deep copying, for
       lists, strings, etc.?
    A: p.21 and 108 (need to read them)
    Q: how do I tell whether a given object is (a subclass) of a given type?
        http://www.secnetix.de/~olli/Python/dynamic_typing.hawk talks
        about testing types, but they test for equality, which
        is seldom the right thing to do.
    Q: can I pass things by reference?  e.g. pass a string and
      have two of its chars changed... actually I'm confused about
      string mutability/sharing and stuff.
    Q: can't seem to figure out how to get -tt and -Qwarn and -Werror
      all at once on the intial #! line???

    Q: what does the unary * operator do?  It's used in both of the following:
        http://www.secnetix.de/~olli/Python/tricks.hawk
        http://www.norvig.com/python-iaq.html
    A(partial): Beazley p.64: when in a function declaration,
       it's for varargs: if the last parameter name
       is preceded by *, that param absorbs any remaining args given into a
       list.  There's also a ** which does more, using a hash.
       Oh wait, olli's example uses it a different way,
       so there's more to it... when I figure this out,
       take a look at olli's page again.
       Okay, there's more to it on the transposing-matrices trick in:
           http://www.norvig.com/python-iaq.html
       I have the impression that passing *list to a function
       turns the n-element list into n distinct args.

ANSWERED QUESTIONS (most recent first):
    Q: beazley p.17 says "..." is used in extended slicing operations,
       but I don't see that on p.24?
    A: see p.33.  E.g. a[i:j:stride], a[i:j, n:m], or a[..., i:j]
       But I still have no idea what the last one is supposed to mean,

    Q: How does it make the path used for imports,
       and how to print that path?
    A: Print it via:
        import sys; sys.path
       It consists of:
        [<dir of script, following symlinks, or '' if none>, '.', <elements of $PYTHONPATH>, ...system lib places...]

    Q: time.clock() always returns 0.17999999999999999 -- what the hell?
    A: ah, the clock is stopped when not doing anything in the interpreter,
       and seems to have a resolution of 1/100 second-- so,
       execute something like max(range(1e6)) and afterwards it will show
       a different value.
    Q: can I have local variables and compound statements in a lambda function?
    A: no but can work around using dirty tricks,
       see "Lambda Limitations" section of:
        http://p-nand-q.com/python/stupid_lambda_tricks.html
       E.g. for local variables, use helper lambdas which
       declare the desired variable as a param with default value.
       And I think maybe local function definitions can do anything
       lambdas can do? need to experiment with the example olli gives
       of the incrementor.

    Q: can I make the equivalient of a "toString()" member of a class,
       to control how objects are printed (i.e. to control what str(obj)
       returns).  How about to control what repr(obj) returns?
    A: The __str__ and __repr__ member functions.

    Q: How are nested ifs/elses disambiguated?
    A: By indentation-- an else matches the last preceding if
       at the same indent level.

    Q: What are semantics of tabs?
    A: Apparently tabs are expanded to 8-space tab stops.

    Q: What's the deal with the memory allocator? Valgrind
       reports it's doing out-of-bounds memory reads.


PYTHON PROS AND CONS:
    - Indenting to denote block structure
            PROS:
               - avoids bugs over which "if" an "else" matches
               - code is typically more compact (fewer lines) than
                 equivalent C or Perl which waste lines on braces,
                 with no decrease in readability
                 (of course, can put those braces on same lines
                 in C or perl, but that makes the code hard to manage)
            CONS:
               - I often want to indent a bunch of code
                 because it is logically a group,
                 but I don't want to make a function out of it.  Can't.
                 Especially, I always want to indent the bunch of code
                 that I think of as "main()".  Just can't.
               - I often want to make a local block with local variables
                 that disappear when the block is exited.  Can't.
               - no delimiting characters like {},
                 so can't use brace matching in an editor
                 to easily traverse from beginning to end of a block and back,
                 or to tell the editor to increase or decrease indentation level
                 of a whole block at once.
               - can't just cut-and-paste code samples from a file
                 or web page into the interpreter, if they are indented--
                 it gives a syntax error.
    CON: don't have to declare variables (like perl's non-strict mode)--
      This encourages sloppiness and bugs.
      (even if a "strict" mode were introduced,
      the usefulness would be limited because
      of the lack of block structure for scoping variables--
      no wait, that's not true, a block is an indentation level.
      yeah I think that makes sense-- I want the scope of a variable
      to be the indented block it's defined in)
    CON: commands.getoutput() strips the final newline, if any.
      so when I care about that, I have to use something more complicated--
      what a pain.  perl does this right, i.e. it retains the newline
      (sh and csh do it wrong).
      (although, can use os.popen('hostname').read() or whatever,
      when we want to retain newline)
    PRO: -1%10 is 9.  HOORAY!!! A LANGUAGE THAT GETS THIS RIGHT, FINALLY!!!!!
    CON: no ternary ?: operator??? oh come on, give me a break!
      can sometimes simulate it using ands and ors, but not always.
            a ? b : c
            a and b or c
      but only if b is guaranteed to return True...
      or   [b, c][bool(a)]
      (from http://www.secnetix.de/~olli/Python/tricks.hawk)
      or   (a and [b] or [c])[0]
      (from http://p-nand-q.com/python/stupid_lambda_tricks.html
       which is from the FAQ)
      but those don't get short-circuit evaluation,  XXX huh? yes they do
      (most complete discussion of this is in the iaq,
      which might actually give something that really works
      but is just a little obscure... need to read it)
      Trick for delayed execution is to use a simple lambda without arguments:
          [lambda:b, lambda:c][not not a]()
      or:
          (a and (lambda:b) or (lambda:c))()
    CON: print seems awkward, the way I can't put parens around its args
      without changing the meaning (e.g. print 1,2 is different from print(1,2))
      Maybe I'll get used to that.
      (turns out everyone hates print, even the author of python)
      alternative (from the iaq):
        def printf(format, *args): print format % args,
      but that puts a space at the end.  So use this intead:
        import sys
        def printf(format, *args): sys.stdout.write(format % args)
    PRO: function declarations are MUCH more readable than perl,
      and the named arguments and default arguments are great for useability
      (although I try not to use default arguments very often,
      since it makes functions harder to use / remember the prototypes
      of, when not all usages of it are the same)
    CON: regular expression handling seems a lot more awkward than in perl
      (using the group() stuff to retrieve matches and stuff?  maybe I'll
      get used to this...)
    CON: post-increment and pre-decrement is really useful for implementing
      stacks and things-- too bad we don't have em (and that
      using ++ and -- doesn't even give a warning if pre, they
      are just silently interpreted as double-unary-plus or double-unary-minus)
    CON: jeez, if I just want to exit, I have to import sys and call sys.exit()?
      This is a (minor) pain.
    PRO: stringification (using `` or repr()) is at your fingertips--
      this is essential, and great.  (In perl, you have to write your own,
      typically a wrapper around Data::Dumper that tweaks its settings
      and corrects its behavior for lists.)
    PRO: functional programming (with correct semantics for nested scopes).
      Anonymous functions are concise and readable-- nice.
      see http://www.secnetix.de/~olli/Python/lambda_functions.hawk
      (although-- can I have local variables and compound statements?
       no, see workarounds above)
    PRO: have to use "this" or "self" explicitly-- right on,
      makes code much more readable.
    CON: can treat non-bools as bools.  this encourages bugs.
      (Java gets this one right, C/C++ and perl don't.)
      the rules are impossible to remember:
      http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth
    PRO: range(0,100) means 0..99 instead of 0..100.
      This avoids all the -1's all over the place like in perl.
    CON: requiring \ at end of line when splitting lines
      is somewhat error prone-- extra space can get inserted
      when cutting and pasting or moving from unix to dos file systems
