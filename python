            It's easy to make other objects == None, by writing buggy __eq__
            methods.  That doesn't happen much, but it's easier with __ne__, where
            the negated logic is easy to screw up.  I've seen it happen. Use "is

            Because there surely are still libraries out there that return 0 and 1
            as true/false values. The bool type was introduced in (by memory)
            Python 2.2 or 2.3, so very old code may fail, or worse, silently do the
            wrong thing if you use "is True".

GOTCHAS:
    - "".split(",") returns [""].
      I actually think maybe this is the best answer, now that I've thought about it.
      Originally I thought was insane, so I wrote this:

          It's a chronic unfortunate situation. When I care about readability of the calling code, I'll hide the conditional inside a helper function:
              def non_insane_split(s,sep): return [] if s=="" else s.split(sep)
      But then I deleted it on 9/7.

    - Do not ever use "for line in sys.stdin:"; it will ruin your day!
      If pauses for a while, it won't see any lines even if many are buffered.

        # (see https://bugs.python.org/issue26290)

        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3670323/setting-smaller-buffer-size-for-sys-stdin
      I think I want to file a bug report on it. Similar to:
        http://bugs.python.org/issue1195 Problems on Linux with Ctrl-D and Ctrl-C during raw_input
        http://bugs.python.org/issue1633941 for line in sys.stdin: doesn't notice EOF the first time
      I filed a bug http://bugs.python.org/issue26290 , with the following contents:
        ============================================================
        Title: fileinput and 'for line in sys.stdin' do strange mockery of input buffering

        Iterating over input using either 'for line in fileinput.input():'
        or 'for line in sys.stdin:' has the following unexpected behavior:
        no matter how many lines of input the process reads, the loop body is not
        entered until either (1) at least 8193 chars have been read and at least one of
        them was a newline, or (2) EOF is read (i.e. the read() system call returns
        zero bytes).

        The behavior I expect instead is what
        "for line in iter(sys.stdin.readline, ''):" does: that is, the loop body is
        entered for the first time as soon as a newline or EOF is read.
        Furthermore strace reveals that this well-behaved alternative code does
        sensible input buffering, in the sense that the underlying system call being
        made is read(0,buf,8192), thereby allowing it to get as many characters as are
        available on input, up to 8192 of them, to be buffered and used in subsequent
        loop iterations.  This is familiar and sensible behavior, and is what I think
        of as "input buffering".

        I anticipate there will be responses to this bug report of the form "this is
        documented behavior; the fileinput and sys.stdin iterators do input buffering".
        To that, I say: no, these iterators' unfriendly behavior is *not* input
        buffering in any useful sense; my impression is that someone may have
        implemented what they thought the words "input buffering" meant, but if so,
        they really botched it.

        This bug is most noticeable and harmful when using a filter written in python
        to filter the output of an ongoing process that may have long pauses between
        lines of output; e.g. running "tail -f" on a log file.  In this case, the
        python filter spends a lot of time in a state where it is paused without
        reason, having read many input lines that it has not yet processed.

        If there is any suspicion that the delayed output is due to the previous
        program in the pipeline buffering its output instead, strace can be used on the
        python filter process to confirm that its input lines are in fact being read in
        a timely manner.  This is certainly true if the previous process in the
        pipeline is "tail -f", at least on my ubuntu linux system.

        To demonstrate the bug, run each of the following from the bash command line.
        This was observed using bash 4.3.11(1), python 2.7.6, and python 3.4.3,
        on ubuntu 14.04 linux.

        ----------------------------------------------
        { echo a;echo b;echo c;sleep 1;} | python2.7 -c $'import fileinput,sys\nfor line in fileinput.input(): sys.stdout.write("line: "+line)'
            # result (BAD): pauses for 1 second, prints the three lines, returns to prompt

        { echo a;echo b;echo c;sleep 1;} | python2.7 -c $'import sys\nfor line in sys.stdin: sys.stdout.write("line: "+line)'
            # result (BAD): pauses for 1 second, prints the three lines, returns to prompt

        { echo a;echo b;echo c;sleep 1;} | python2.7 -c $'import sys\nfor line in iter(sys.stdin.readline, ""): sys.stdout.write("line: "+line)'
            # result (GOOD): prints the three lines, pauses for 1 second, returns to prompt

        { echo a;echo b;echo c;sleep 1;} | python3.4 -c $'import fileinput,sys\nfor line in fileinput.input(): sys.stdout.write("line: "+line)'
            # result (BAD): pauses for 1 second, prints the three lines, returns to prompt

        { echo a;echo b;echo c;sleep 1;} | python3.4 -c $'import sys\nfor line in sys.stdin: sys.stdout.write("line: "+line)'
            # result (GOOD): prints the three lines, pauses for 1 second, returns to prompt

        { echo a;echo b;echo c;sleep 1;} | python3.4 -c $'import sys\nfor line in iter(sys.stdin.readline, ""): sys.stdout.write("line: "+line)'
            # result (GOOD): prints the three lines, pauses for 1 second, returns to prompt
        ----------------------------------------------

        Notice the 'for line in sys.stdin:' behavior is apparently fixed in python 3.4.
        So the matrix of behavior observed above can be summarized as follows:

                                                   2.7  3.4
        for line in fileinput.input():             BAD  BAD
        for line in sys.stdin:                     BAD  GOOD
        for line in iter(sys.stdin.readline, ""):  GOOD GOOD

        Note that adding '-u' to the python args makes no difference in behavior, in
        any of the above 6 command lines.

        Finally, if I insert "strace -T" before "python" in each of the 6 command lines
        above, it confirms that the python process is reading the 3 lines of input
        immediately in all cases, in a single read(..., ..., 4096 or 8192) which seems
        reasonable.
        ===============================================


    - To get the last suffixLength elements of a list or tuple,
      listOrTuple[-suffixLength:] works most of the time,
      but it fails unexpectedly if suffixLength is 0,
      wrongly returning the whole array!
      For a robust idiom, use listOrTuple[len(listOrTuple)-suffixLength:]
      instead.

    - --x does not increment x !!!  it returns -(-x)). Likewise for ++x, etc.
      Need to use x-=1 and x+=1 instead, and there's no equivalent of
      post-increment or post-decrement.  Attempting them will usually
      give an error, except in cases like x++ - y which is treated
      as x + (+(-(y)). :-(

    - x = 3; print("x =", x)
      prints the list stringified, with parens and comma
      (although print("x") doesn't print the parens).
      Weird.  Need to omit the parens from the call, I guess.
      Oh I see, it's treatin it as a tuple, not as function args!

    - a global variable can be looked at, or its elements assigned to,
      in a function, but the variable itself can't be assigned to
      unless you say "global x".  Without that, it will create
      a local variable and assign to it instead. :-(
      Also got bit by the following:
      in my main body (which is just statements in global scope),
      I created some variables, which became global...
      then I referred to that name by accident in a function,
      and it saw them instead of giving an error like I would
      have liked...  from now on I'm going to make an explicit main()
      to prevent this.

    - evidently semantics will be changing
      so that division is by default float division;
      see the -Q option in the man page.
      Use // for integer division (or divmod to get both quotient and remainder).
      (The Beazley book doesn't mention this.)

    - string functions that test for "is all something"
      return false on empty string-- lame!
        isalnum
        isalpha
        isdigit
        islower ("all cased characters... and there is at least one cased character" !)
        isspace
        istitle
        isupper ("all cased characters... and there is at least one cased character" !)
      Is there a good workaround other than writing my own replacement?
      (see http://p-nand-q.com/python/stupid_lambda_tricks.html
      for an approach to a similar issue for list functions
      that sometimes return None)

    - bizarre symlink behavior when importing-- follows the symlink
      and looks for the imported files there.

    - Generator functions are NOT "tuple comprehension"!
      E.g.
          (10**i for i in xrange(3))
      behaves differently from
          [10**i for i in xrange(3)]
      as follows:
          >>>foo = [10**i for i in xrange(3)]
          >>> print [x for x in foo]
          [1, 10, 100]
          >>> print [x for x in foo]
          [1, 10, 100]
          >>> print [x for x in foo]
          [1, 10, 100]

          >>> bar = (10**i for i in xrange(3))
          >>> print [x for x in bar]
          [1, 10, 100]
          >>> print [x for x in bar]
          []
          >>> print [x for x in bar]
          []

                print [f() for f in [lambda n=n:range(n) for n in range(4)]]
            similarly for the other one.

        - lambda scopes are broken:

            >> [f(4) for f in fs]
            [13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13]
          workaround:
            >> fs = [(lambda n,i=i: i + n) for i in range(10)]
            >> [f(4) for f in fs]
            [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
          see:
              http://math.andrej.com/2009/04/09/pythons-lambda-is-broken/

      UPDATE: wait a minute, I think I'm changing my position on this.
      see mcmanus's comment, April 9, 2009 at 19:44:
          Take the following Python example:
          >>> i = 1
          >>> def f(): return i
          >>> f()
          1
          >>> i = 2
          >>> f()
          2
          I think that everybody expect this behavior and nobody would want
          the second call to f() to return 1.
      I don't think I can have it both ways!
      Default args are cute, but certainly abusive.
      Perhaps:
          >>> makeIncrementor = lambda i: lambda n: n+i
      or:
          >>> def makeIncrementor(i): return lambda n: n+i
      and then:
          >>> fs = [makeIncrementor(i) for i in range(10)]
          >>> [f(4) for f in fs]


    - leaky scopes, see http://functional-orbitz.blogspot.com/2011/05/sometimes-i-forget-full-degree-in-which.html
        >>> [s for s in [1, 2,3]]
        [1, 2, 3]
        >>> s
        3
      (fixed in python3)


    - 1==True and 13==True evaluate to False, but
      bool(1)==True and bool(13)==True evaluate to True


     

THINGS I DIDN'T SEE AT FIRST:
    - for ... else   what a waste of my time having to research what this means
    - try ... else   what a waste of my time having to research what this means
    - reduce() has an optional "initial" parameter... so it's
      not zero-phobic after all!
      e.g. print reduce(lambda s,x: s+" %d"%x, [0,1,2], "foo:")
      This makes it much more useful!
      Although it would be even more useful, maybe, if
      it had an optional special-case-for-only-one-item parameter too...
    - == is deep, "is" is shallow (pointer compare)
        but wait: a = 1+1; b = 2; a is b

TRICKS:
    - from http://www.norvig.com/python-iaq.html:
      To avoid typing quotes around key names:
            def Dict(**dict): return dict
            Dict(a=1, b=2, c=3, dee=4)
            {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c': 3, 'dee': 4}
      and there's a similar thing for objects.
    - to get a local variable inside a lambda, use a helper lambda inside,
       which declares the desired variable as a param with default value.
       From http://p-nand-q.com/python/stupid_lambda_tricks.html:
           f = lambda x: (lambda result=range(20):do_something(result,x))()
           As mentioned above, local variables are best used in a list,
           because that way you can use [].__setitem__ for data assignments.

TO EXPERIMENT WITH:
    - hmm! all standard types (string, integer) are classes and so can be
      sublassed?
    - http://www.secnetix.de/~olli/Python/dynamic_typing.hawk mentions
      doctest module for automated regression tests?
    - need to get good at regular expressions stuff
    - try to find another example where a "finally" will fail to execute--
      (stack overflow inside nested finallies, or something)
    - see whether can implement olli's incrementor (returning
      a function with a nested scope) using a local function definition
      instead of a lambda-- potentially more versatile.
    - see whether olli's example of parsing command line options:
        http://www.secnetix.de/~olli/Python/tricks.hawk
      is worthwhile
    - read up on semantics of shallow versus deep copying, p.21 and p.108
    - experiment with the bisection module:
        http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-bisect.html
      mentioned in the iaq
    - experiment with, and understand, the iaq's version
      of ternary ?:
    - try the iaq guy's .python startup file
FEATURES TO KEEP IN MIND:
    - time.clock()
    - documentation strings (if first statement of a
      module, class, or function is a string)
    - string concatenation by just putting the strings side-by-side
    - to undefine a variable, use del
    - can do singleton pattern, see the iaq. (note,
      it uses a totally non-obvious semantic of default args)

        http://www.secnetix.de/~olli/Python/dynamic_typing.hawk talks
        about testing types, but they test for equality, which
        is seldom the right thing to do.
    Q: can I pass things by reference?  e.g. pass a string and
      have two of its chars changed... actually I'm confused about
      string mutability/sharing and stuff.
    Q: can't seem to figure out how to get -tt and -Qwarn and -Werror
      all at once on the intial #! line???

    Q: what does the unary * operator do?  It's used in both of the following:
        http://www.secnetix.de/~olli/Python/tricks.hawk
        http://www.norvig.com/python-iaq.html
    A(partial): Beazley p.64: when in a function declaration,
       it's for varargs: if the last parameter name
       is preceded by *, that param absorbs any remaining args given into a
       list.  There's also a ** which does more, using a hash.
       Oh wait, olli's example uses it a different way,
       so there's more to it... when I figure this out,
       take a look at olli's page again.
       Okay, there's more to it on the transposing-matrices trick in:
           http://www.norvig.com/python-iaq.html
       I have the impression that passing *list to a function
       turns the n-element list into n distinct args.

    Q: How to convert back and forth between tuple and list?
    Q: Why would I want to use a tuple instead of a list? (Faster for const?)

ANSWERED QUESTIONS (most recent first):
    Q: Cascading regular expression matching logic using re.match is awkward.
       Is there a better way?
    A: I've been using the following which works pretty well.
	  # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1663995/how-to-avoid-writing-request-get-get-twice-in-order-to-print-it#answer-1664013
	  class DataHolder:
	    def __init__(self, value=None): self.value = value
	    def set(self, value): self.value = value; return value
	    def get(self): return self.value
	  # DataHolder makes cascading re searches/matches less awkward.
	  # Instead of this:
	  #       match = re.search(pat0, line)
	  #       if match is not None:
	  #         ... do something with match ...
	  #       else:
	  #         match = re.search(pat1, line)
	  #         if match is not None:
	  #           ... do something with match ...
	  #         else:
	  #           ...
	  # Say this:
	  #       match = DataHolder()
	  #       if match.set(re.search(pat0, line)) is not None:
	  #         ... do something with match.get() ...
	  #       elif match.set(re.search(pat1, line)) is not None:
	  #         ... do something with match.get() ...
	  #       else:
	  #         ...


    Q: where's that cool writeup of datetime,time,etc stuff with diagrams?
    A: a few different nice ones

    Q: beazley p.17 says "..." is used in extended slicing operations,
       but I don't see that on p.24?
    A: see p.33.  E.g. a[i:j:stride], a[i:j, n:m], or a[..., i:j]
       But I still have no idea what the last one is supposed to mean,
       and it gives an error in the interpreter!?

    Q: running other programs?
    A: os.system('date')

    Q: environment variables?
    A: os.environ
       os.environ['FOO'] = 'BAR'
       del os.environ['FOO']
       

    Q: isatty?
    A: import sys; sys.stdin.isatty()

    Q: trying to use vi as a clipboard, I can't do this:
        if True: print "hello"
        print "goodbye"
       nor any other way...
    A: xterm -xrm trimSelection=true
       and put a blank line between them. :-(

    Q: how to access the current line number in a script, similar to __LINE__ in c++ or perl?
    A: from http://code.activestate.com/recipes/145297/ :
        import inspect
        def lineno():
            """Returns the current line number in our program."""
            return inspect.currentframe().f_back.f_lineno

    Q: how to see the doc string for a function or method?
    A: print funcname.__doc__
       print obj.methodname.__doc__

    Q: how to see all the available methods of an object?
    A: dir(obj)
       although it's not reliable, nothing is, apparently :-(

    Q: how to print without a newline?
    A: sys.stdout.write('foo')

    Q: How does it make the path used for imports,
       and how to print that path?
    A: Print it via:
        import sys; sys.path
       It consists of:
        [<dir of script, following symlinks, or '' if none>, '.', <elements of $PYTHONPATH>, ...system lib places...]

    Q: time.clock() always returns 0.17999999999999999 -- what the hell?
    A: ah, the clock is stopped when not doing anything in the interpreter,
       and seems to have a resolution of 1/100 second-- so,
       execute something like max(range(1e6)) and afterwards it will show
       a different value.
    Q: can I have local variables and compound statements in a lambda function?
    A: no but can work around using dirty tricks,
       see "Lambda Limitations" section of:
        http://p-nand-q.com/python/stupid_lambda_tricks.html
       E.g. for local variables, use helper lambdas which
       declare the desired variable as a param with default value.
       And I think maybe local function definitions can do anything
       lambdas can do? need to experiment with the example olli gives
       of the incrementor.

    Q: can I make the equivalient of a "toString()" member of a class,
       to control how objects are printed (i.e. to control what str(obj)
       returns).  How about to control what repr(obj) returns?
    A: The __str__ and __repr__ member functions.

    Q: How are nested ifs/elses disambiguated?
    A: By indentation-- an else matches the last preceding if
       at the same indent level.

    Q: What are semantics of tabs?
    A: Apparently tabs are expanded to 8-space tab stops.

    Q: What's the deal with the memory allocator? Valgrind
       reports it's doing out-of-bounds memory reads.


PYTHON PROS AND CONS:
    - Indenting to denote block structure
            PROS:
               - avoids bugs over which "if" an "else" matches
               - code is typically more compact (fewer lines) than
                 equivalent C or Perl which waste lines on braces,
                 with no decrease in readability
                 (of course, can put those braces on same lines
                 in C or perl, but that makes the code hard to manage)
            CONS:
               - I often want to indent a bunch of code
                 because it is logically a group,
                 but I don't want to make a function out of it.  Can't.
                 Especially, I always want to indent the bunch of code
                 that I think of as "main()".  Just can't.
               - I often want to make a local block with local variables
                 that disappear when the block is exited.  Can't.
               - no delimiting characters like {},
                 so can't use brace matching in an editor
                 to easily traverse from beginning to end of a block and back,
                 or to tell the editor to increase or decrease indentation level
                 of a whole block at once.
               - can't just cut-and-paste code samples from a file
                 or web page into the interpreter, if they are indented--
                 it gives a syntax error.
    CON: don't have to declare variables (like perl's non-strict mode)--
      This encourages sloppiness and bugs.
      (even if a "strict" mode were introduced,
      the usefulness would be limited because
      of the lack of block structure for scoping variables--
      no wait, that's not true, a block is an indentation level.
      yeah I think that makes sense-- I want the scope of a variable
      to be the indented block it's defined in)
    CON: commands.getoutput() strips the final newline, if any.
      so when I care about that, I have to use something more complicated--
      what a pain.  perl does this right, i.e. it retains the newline
      (sh and csh do it wrong).
      (although, can use os.popen('hostname').read() or whatever,
      when we want to retain newline)
    PRO: -1%10 is 9.  HOORAY!!! A LANGUAGE THAT GETS THIS RIGHT, FINALLY!!!!!
    CON: no ternary ?: operator??? oh come on, give me a break!
      can sometimes simulate it using ands and ors, but not always.
            a ? b : c
            a and b or c
      but only if b is guaranteed to return True...
      or   [b, c][bool(a)]
      (from http://www.secnetix.de/~olli/Python/tricks.hawk)
      or   (a and [b] or [c])[0]
      (from http://p-nand-q.com/python/stupid_lambda_tricks.html
       which is from the FAQ)
      but those don't get short-circuit evaluation,  XXX huh? yes they do
      (most complete discussion of this is in the iaq,
      which might actually give something that really works
      but is just a little obscure... need to read it)
      Trick for delayed execution is to use a simple lambda without arguments:
          [lambda:b, lambda:c][not not a]()
      or:
          (a and (lambda:b) or (lambda:c))()
    CON: print seems awkward, the way I can't put parens around its args
      without changing the meaning (e.g. print 1,2 is different from print(1,2))
      Maybe I'll get used to that.
      (turns out everyone hates print, even the author of python)
      alternative (from the iaq):
        def printf(format, *args): print format % args,
      but that puts a space at the end.  So use this intead:
        import sys
        def printf(format, *args): sys.stdout.write(format % args)
    PRO: function declarations are MUCH more readable than perl,
      and the named arguments and default arguments are great for useability
      (although I try not to use default arguments very often,
      since it makes functions harder to use / remember the prototypes
      of, when not all usages of it are the same)
    CON: regular expression handling seems a lot more awkward than in perl
      (using the group() stuff to retrieve matches and stuff?  maybe I'll
      get used to this...)
    CON: post-increment and pre-decrement is really useful for implementing
      stacks and things-- too bad we don't have em (and that
      using ++ and -- doesn't even give a warning if pre, they
      are just silently interpreted as double-unary-plus or double-unary-minus)
    CON: jeez, if I just want to exit, I have to import sys and call sys.exit()?
      This is a (minor) pain.
    PRO: stringification (using `` or repr()) is at your fingertips--
      this is essential, and great.  (In perl, you have to write your own,
      typically a wrapper around Data::Dumper that tweaks its settings
      and corrects its behavior for lists.)
    PRO: functional programming (with correct semantics for nested scopes).
      Anonymous functions are concise and readable-- nice.
      see http://www.secnetix.de/~olli/Python/lambda_functions.hawk
      (although-- can I have local variables and compound statements?
       no, see workarounds above)
    PRO: have to use "this" or "self" explicitly-- right on,
      makes code much more readable.
    CON: can treat non-bools as bools.  this encourages bugs.
      (Java gets this one right, C/C++ and perl don't.)
      the rules are impossible to remember:
      http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth
    PRO: range(0,100) means 0..99 instead of 0..100.
      This avoids all the -1's all over the place like in perl.
    CON: requiring \ at end of line when splitting lines
      is somewhat error prone-- extra space can get inserted
      when cutting and pasting or moving from unix to dos file systems
