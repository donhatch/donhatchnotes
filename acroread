Q: how to paste from a terminal window into acroread?
A: klipper
       Configure klipper...
                  change clipboard/selection behavior to "synchronize contents of the clipboard and selection"
   Then I can copy text from a terminal window by sweeping it out with the left mouse button,
   and paste it into acroread using ctrl-v.
