Q: My work firewall times me out after 60 minutes (or something)...
   how to prevent this on the client side?
A: man ssh_config
   Add one of the following to ~/.ssh/config:
       TCPKeepAlive yes
   or:
       ServerAliveInterval 900
   Not sure what the implications of one versus the other is,
   but I'm using the latter... I'll let you know how it goes.
