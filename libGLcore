Trying to figure out how to see who in libGL.so.1
calls whom in libGLcore.so.1.

From ld.so man page:
    LD_DEBUG
        (glibc since 2.1) Output verbose debugging informa
        tion about the  dynamic  linker.   If  set  to  all
        prints  all debugging information it has, if set to
        help prints a help message about  which  categories
        can be specified in this environment variable.

    % setenv LD_DEBUG help
    % cat
        Valid options for the LD_DEBUG environment variable are:
         
          libs        display library search paths
          reloc       display relocation processing
          files       display progress for input file
          symbols     display symbol table processing
          bindings    display information about symbol binding
          versions    display version dependencies
          all         all previous options combined
          statistics  display relocation statistics
          help        display this help message and exit
         
        To direct the debugging output into a file instead of standard output
        a filename can be specified using
        the LD_DEBUG_OUTPUT environment variable.
    % setenv LD_DEBUG all
    % glxinfo
Almost, but no cigar... it says when it's looking up the symbol,
but no clue what function wanted it.
