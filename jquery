Q: how to put stuff in the clipboard?
A: ZeroClipboard. note it doesn't work with file://
   but it's easy to run a simple httpd server:
       python -m SimpleHTTPServer
   which will start with a directory listing of the directory
   in which the server was started.

I figured out how to fix the "Hide/Show Totals" button, so it's totally zippy now.

(apparently jquery's show()/hide() functions are ridiculously slow when showing/hiding multiple table rows; I think it's quadratic in the table size, or something...
but if I change it to simply change the table rows' css "display" property between "none" and ""
instead, it accomplishes the same thing and it's really fast).

ADDED NOTE: something about duration? by default, show/hide do a fade
