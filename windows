Customizations (mostly Windows Vista):

ANNOYANCES/AGGRAVATIONS and my current workarounds:

X-Mouse
    1. How to enable it?
       possible relevant links:
           http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/9000-mouse-hover-makes-window-active-enable.html
           http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/nt/TXMouse/

       This worked:
        On vista:
            TweakVI
                Misc Tweaks
                    Mouse Tweaks
                        "Enable Window tracking using your mouse cursor"
                        reboot :-(
            "Ultimate Windows Tweaker" doesn't seem to have any mouse-related stuff
            True X-Mouse
                (cool, when using this, clicking in a window doesn't raise it!)
                (oh no! does it mess up my AutoHotkey hotkeys for F1 and F2??
                 yes!  argh!)
                (and it causes crazy flakey behavior... right click
                on ConEmu title bar pushes window to back
                instead of bringing up Settings :-( )
            X-Mouse Controls
                http://joelpurra.com/Projects/X-Mouse_Controls/
                looks good, but it's source only-- need visual studio?? :-(
            maybe using AutoHotKey? http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/20996-auto-raise-mouse-hover/

    2. Certain apps automatically raise the window
       when they recieve focus, therefore are extremely unfriendly
       when using x-mouse:
           gimp (if not in windows->"single window mode")
           java (starting with 1.7) (but only within same application??)
           visual studio (if I recall correctly-- don't have it at this moment)
       Q: what makes them do that?
       Q: is there a way to prevent them from doing that?
          (intercept something?)

Non-resizeable windows

    Examples:
        - file or shortcut Properties dialog
        - System properties
        - environment variables

    There's a tool called ResizeEnable
    which works sometimes, but it has extremely unfriendly interaction
    with chrome so I have it turned off most of the time,
    and I turn it on temporarily when I want to resize a window.


Good tools:
    AutoHotKey
    Console2 (mostly obsoleted by ConEmu)
    ConEmu (obsoletes Console2 except for https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/issues/detail?id=1004)
    Dependency walker (depends)
    Process Explorer (procexp)
        to select the process of a window:
            drag the target thingy onto the window
        to see properties of a process:
            select it and:
                Process->Properties
                or hit Enter
                or double click on it
        to see what files a process has open:
            select the process (click on it, or type first few chars of name)
            View -> Show Lower Pane
            Vier -> Lower Pane View -> Handles



Q: what the hell does "search everywhere" mean?
A: According to
       http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/the-start-menu-overview
   it means "search your entire computer".

Q: how to open a script from the command line
   like clicking in explorer?
PA: explorer <script>
   but how to pass it args?

Q: and how to bypass explorer and bring up the explorer right-click menu?

Q: I keep forgetting how to set environment variables
A: start -> *right click* on computer -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables

Q: I keep forgetting what all the parts of the windows desktop are?
A:
        start menu   taskbar   system tray

    Q: how to make a .cmd script that runs a program,
       forwarding the command line args?
    A: %*  and yes it seems to get quoted right (in simple cases anyway)
