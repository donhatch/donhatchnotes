ANSWERED QUESTIONS:
Q: how to separate curves when plotting datafiles with lines?
A: According to "help datafile":
   In datafiles, blank records (records with no characters other than blanks and
   a newline and/or carriage return) are significant---pairs of blank records
   separate `index`es (see `plot datafile index`).  Data separated by double
   blank records are treated as if they were in separate data files.
