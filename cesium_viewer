    Not very helpful :-(

  Empirically:
    LMB:
    - If looking straight at earth with north pole up:
      - left/right: twirl earth around polar axis
      - up/down: tilt north pole away from / towards camera
    - If looking straight at earth with north pole not up:
      - same, but rotated
    Tilt/twirl earth.
