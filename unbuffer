unbuffer program!  On ubuntu, it's in the expect-dev package.

Common misconception is that the 'stdbuf' program does it,
but in fact it's useless.  From its man page:
"NOTE: If COMMAND adjusts the buffering of its standard  streams  ('tee'
does  for  e.g.) then that will override corresponding settings changed
by 'stdbuf'.
