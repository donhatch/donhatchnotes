To run a simple httpd server:
  python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port]
Default port is 8000.
or for python 3+
  python3 -m http.server 8888
That will start with a directory listing of the directory
in which the server was started.

I've tried:
  python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port]
    - seems fine
    - no ..? why? (it shouldn't go past the root of course)
  twistd -no web --path=.
    - seems to work fine. maybe better performance than the python way, not sure
    - nicer than python since annotates with sizes and types
    - no ..? why? (it shouldn't go past the root of course)
  go myserver.go
    - requires making a little source file
    - doesn't sort the directory entries!? so not very usable
  hg serve
    - only serves an hg repository, so not generally useful
  git instaweb --start
    - like hg serve but should be more useful to me since I actually use git
    - on ubuntu, required "sudo apt-get install lighttpd"
    - not exactly obvious where to click: it's the summary/shortlog/log/tree links

Also a list of alternatives here:

Ones not mentioned already:
  ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8888
