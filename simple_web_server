To run a simple httpd server:
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port]
Default port is 8000.
That will start with a directory listing of the directory
in which the server was started.

I've tried:
  twistd -no web --path=.
    - seems to work fine. maybe better performance than the python way, not sure
    - nicer than python since annotates with sizes and types
  go myserver.go
    - requires making a little source file
    - doesn't sort the directory entries!? so not very usable
  hg serve
    - only serves an hg repository, so not generally useful
  git instaweb --start
    - like hg serve but should be more useful to me since I actually use git
    - on ubuntu, required "sudo apt-get install lighttpd"
    - not exactly obvious where to click: it's the summary/shortlog/log/tree links
