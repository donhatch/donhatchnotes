From Tommy 8/10/07

I run jed parson's "rmlock" script when things like this pop up and it
seems to take care of most issues:

/home/tommy/bin/rmlock -> /san/dept/training/bin/rmlock*

Q: how to open NOW files?
   e.g. http://start/infosys/supportq/view/36589
A: http://lois4/document/lucas-mimehandler-setup-httpstart
   Holy moly it worked!

       /sww/gfx/bin/lucas-mime-handler

  See notes in "mime" for more info.

Q: how to get local file links to work from non-local ones?
A: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Links_to_local_pages_don%27t_work
   added this to my ~/.mozilla/firefox/????????.default/prefs.js :
       user_pref("capability.policy.policynames", "localfilelinks");
       user_pref("capability.policy.localfilelinks.sites", "http://alanon:8010");
       user_pref("capability.policy.localfilelinks.checkloaduri.enabled", "allAccess");
   EEEK!  Per comment 142 in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84128,
   put that in a user.js instead!!
   And it only needs:
      user_pref("capability.policy.localfilelinks.sites", "http://alanon:8010");
   So:
      cd ~/.mozilla/firefox/????????.default
      echo 'user_pref("capability.policy.localfilelinks.sites", "http://alanon:8010");' >>! user.js
   (however, to remove it, you'll have to edit prefs.js... bleah!!)

Q: how to set the default printer?
A: about:config

Q: how to just kill a long-running script that's slowing down firefox,
   rather than killing firefox?
   and how to locate the malfunctioning page so I can close it,
   rather than restarting the rogue script again?
   http://serendipity.ruwenzori.net/index.php/2013/03/02/which-firefox-tabs-rogue-javascript-is-hogging-the-cpu-here-is-the-answer
   http://kb.mozillazine.org/Unresponsive_Script_Warning

   Ok I got the javascript deobfuscator, I think I identified it
   but I don't see how to find which tab to close
   or how to kill the script :-(
