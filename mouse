Someone keeps resetting my mouse!
To get the mouse settings:
    xset q | grep acceleration
When hyper:
      acceleration:  5/1    threshold:  10
When normal:
      acceleration:  2/1    threshold:  10

To fix it:
    xset m[ouse] 2/1 10

To see who's been running jobs on your machine:
    /net/dlogs/<your machine name>/obaq.log
It will show up shortly after the mouse settings got changed (I think).
