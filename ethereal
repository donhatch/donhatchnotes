Q: how to figure out how to filter out a particular kind of packet,
   either in capture or display?  I want to filter out ARP and UDP/DHCP
A: short answer:
        capture filter: not arp and not udp port 68
        display filter: not arp and !(udp.port==68)
                    or: not arp and not bootp
   long answer:
        capture filters: man tcpdump
        display filters: man ethereal-filter

Q: How about, more specifically, to filter out
   just the dhcp traffic that's not associated with me?
   Let's see how these packets look:
       Empirically, stuff associated with me:
           Initially:
               DHCP ACK(Reply): 73.64.12.1:bootps(67)->71.198.8.96:bootpc(68)
           When already running:
               DHCP Request: 0.0.0.0(me):bootpc(68) -> 255.255.255.255:bootps(67)
               DHCP ACK: 73.64.12.1:bootps(67) -> 71.198.8.96(me):bootpc(68)
                        (put my ip address in the data too)
                  (Oh neat!  And I send back a "Destination unreachable",
                   that's charming)
               DHCP Release: 71.198.8.96(me):bootpc(68) -> 68.87.76.13:bootps(67)
       And other stuff happening all the time:
           DHCP Offer: 73.64.12.1:bootps(67)->255.255.255.255:bootpc(68)
                    (with some other ip address in the data)
           DHCP NAK: 73.64.12.1:bootps(67)->255.255.255.255:bootpc(68)
                    (with some other ip address in the data)
           DHCP NAK: 73.64.12.1:bootps(67)->255.255.255.255:bootpc(68)
                    (with 0.0.0.0 in the data)
