to get date in thunderbird replies, e.g. "On sep 18 1984, Joe Bloe wrote:",
look here: http://seamonkey.ilias.ca/mailnewsfaq/Replyintro
    % cd ~/.thunderbird/rg3oo31t.default
    % cp prefs.js user.js
    % vi user.js
        erase all the contents (okay that was lame)
        add this, which means do the non-retarded date thing:
            user_pref("mailnews.reply_header_type", 2);

   remove it!
