Q: how to change window managers, temporarily or permanently?
PA: temporarily:
        killall metacity && sleep 3 && metacity &
    permanently:
        do the above and:
            gnome-session-save
        although this will save the entire session, which includes
        the shell window... so really should probably just do that
        when logging out.  I don't expect it will find the right
        metacity afterwards though :-(
    Hmm, note that metacity says this when you try to run it
    and there is one running:
        Window manager warning: Screen 0 on display ":0.0" already has a window manager; try using the --replace option to replace the current window manager.
