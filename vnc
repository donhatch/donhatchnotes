If no one is logged in, then you need to run this:

sudo x11vnc -rfbauth <vnc-passwd-file> -auth /var/gdm/:0.Xauth -display :0

Then run the vnc client viewer, and you will see the login screen.  Now log in, 
and both the vnc server and client will immediately die.

However, now you're logged in, and you can run vnc as you regularly do.
