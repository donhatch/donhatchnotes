Concerns:
    - math library is different (maybe better),
      e.g. cos(0.029461298225215302)
    - no ddd
    - no icemon64
    - sbowline reports vnc problems
        argh! yeah, can't alt-middle to rotate objects in zeno

QUESTIONS:

Q: how to configure hotkeys (e.g. to raise/lower windows) from the command line?

   Subject: how to configure kde hotkeys from command line?
   How do I configure kde hotkeys (e.g. to raise/lower windows)
   from the command-line?
   E.g. I have F1/F2 configured to raise/lower windows
   (this was hard wired into my synapses long ago; it can't be changed).
   When an app wants an F1 or F2
   usually something like shift-F1 works just as well (e.g. mathematica help),
   or I can use a menu as a last resort...
   However there are some things for which I simply can't
   find another way to get at the feature without F1...
   For example, htop's Help.

   I know I can do
   start menu -> control center (or kcontrol) -> Regional & Accessibility -> Keyboard shortcuts...
   but that amount of interaction, for something
   that I only want for a few seconds at a time,
   completely violates my sensibilities.

   What I want is the ability to say:
     alias myshortcutsoff  <some magic>
     alias myshortcutson  <some anti-magic>
   and then:
     myshortcutsoff
     ... use F1 like normal people do for a few seconds ...
     myshortcutson

   Any clues?

A: (from Thomas Chan):
    alias myshortcutsoff 'kwriteconfig --file kdeglobals --group "Global Shortcuts" --key "Window Raise" "" && kwriteconfig --file kdeglobals --group "Global Shortcuts" --key "Window Lower" "" && dcop kwin KWinInterface reconfigure'
    alias myshortcutson 'kwriteconfig --file kdeglobals --group "Global Shortcuts" --key "Window Raise" "F1" && kwriteconfig --file kdeglobals --group "Global Shortcuts" --key "Window Lower" "F2" && dcop kwin KWinInterface reconfigure'

    Then to see help in htop, in gnome-terminal,
    also need to do: Edit -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Help -> Contents -> clear this out
    then htop, and F1.
    Can't get it at all in konsole, thought Thomas says he can, weird.




Q: how to get it to save my window configuration for next login??
A: kcontrol -> KDE components -> Session manager
    change from "restore previous session"
    to "restore manually saved session"
    wtf? I don't even know how to save a session, so changing it to:
    "start with an empty session"
   (see answer from thomas)

ANSWERED QUESTIONS (most recent first):

Q: I want ctrl-b to backspace over words delimited by spaces, not some other
   freakish idea of what a word is.  How?
A: Look for "wordchars" in the man page.
   The default (when unset) is '*?_-.[]~=â€™.
   So add some stuff:
       set wordchars = '*?_-.[]~=/'

Q: how to make the kde window manager (or whatever)

    most importantly in terminal windows?
A: start menu -> control center (or kcontrol) -> Desktop -> Window Behavior -> Moving -> Display window geometry when moving or resizing -> YES

Q: focus stealing?
A: I don't know the details of what behaves well by default and what doesn't,
   but this sure seems like a good idea so I did it:

   Descriptions of the various levels are available via Help -> what's this?

Q: this isn't loading: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_pqwk-WkBc 
   is it a flash problem?  flash player 7, need flash player 10 or something?
A: yes, download the tar.gz and install it per instructions
   WEIRD, the current download tar.gz just contains the .so,
   without any installation script...
   so, running the one I had from the beginning of last year instead.
   Oh no, it complains not compatible with 64-bit architecture...
   OH, per message from Christopher Marlett 9/18/2009,
   check to make sure there are no plugins in my .mozilla/plugins
   or anywhere in my default profiles plugins folder that would
   be overriding the global default (which should be 10.0.32.18)
   rm ~/.mozilla/plugins/{flashplayer.xpt,libflashplayer.so}
   and restart firefox.
   Yup, that fixed it!

Q: how to make firefox come up when links are clicked on in gnome-terminal

A: control center -> Appearance & Themes -> Window Decorations -> BlueCurve
