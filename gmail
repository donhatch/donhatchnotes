      Subject: how does one check for new messages in a label in gmail?

      The only way I know of to get gmail to load new messages
      when I'm looking at a particular label (e.g. "label:nonbulk")
      is to switch to Inbox and then back to the label, in the left pane.
      I'd expect just clicking on the label would do it
      (like clicking on Inbox does it, when viewing Inbox),
      but it doesn't, usually.

      Is this the intended behavior?
      Is there an easier / less jarring way to check for new messagesÂ 
      when in a label view?

      Don

A: If already in thread view for that label, just click on the label again.
   If not, click on the label once to get in the thread view for the label,
   then click on the label again.


Q: filters?
A: settings -> Filters and Blocked Addresses
