Man page for nice is next to useless:

       With no COMMAND, print the current  niceness.   Nicenesses  range
       from -20 (most favorable scheduling) to 19 (least favorable).

       -n, --adjustment=N
              add integer N to the niceness (default 10)

    NOTE: your shell may have its own version of nice, which usually supersedes
    the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation
    for details about the options it supports.

Let's experiment to see what works:

    cat                     -> NI=0
    /bin/nice cat           -> NI=10
    /bin/nice /bin/nice cat -> NI=19

    (nice; /bin/cat)        -> NI=4
    (nice; nice; /bin/cat)  -> NI=4
    (nice; /bin/nice /bin/cat)        -> NI=14
    nice /bin/nice /bin/cat -> NI=14
    /bin/nice nice /bin/cat -> NI=19  (the second nice is /bin/nice in this case)

    nice /bin/cat           -> NI=4
    (nice /bin/cat)         -> NI=0   (wtf?)

    /bin/nice -n +3 /bin/cat -> NI=3
    /bin/nice -n+3 /bin/cat -> NI=3
    /bin/nice -n 3 /bin/cat -> NI=3
    /bin/nice -n3 /bin/cat -> NI=3


   nice -n 3 /bin/cat -> "nice: Badly formed number"
   nice +3 /bin/cat -> NI=3
   nice -3 /bin/cat -> "setpriority: Permission denied"
