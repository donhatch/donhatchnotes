Here are the source rpms:
(same thing in both places)
    /dept/sio/linux/os/centos/5.3/packages/rnd/python2.6/SRPM/python2.6-2.6.4-lecl.src.rpm
    /dept/rnd/packages/RHEL5_AMD64/SRPMS/python2.6/python2.6-2.6.4-lecl.src.rpm

Here's what I did:

1. Copy the source rpm to ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS.orig/
   My goal is to make python2.6-2.6.4-lecl.valgrindfriendly.src.rpm.

2. Make an rpm "sandbox",
   so I don't need to be root.
   From http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/1715:
        % mkdir -p /var/tmp/doNotRemove/dhatch/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}
        % echo "%_topdir /var/tmp/doNotRemove/dhatch/rpmbuild" > ~/.rpmmacros

3. Extract it into there:
        % cd /var/tmp/doNotRemove/dhatch/rpmbuild/SRPMS.orig/
        % rpm -ivh python2.6-2.6.4-lecl.src.rpm
   That put stuff (.tar.bz2, patches, other stuff) into /var/tmp/doNotRemove/dhatch/rpmbuild/{SOURCES,SPECS}.

4. prep, build, install, build binary and source package
        % cd /var/tmp/doNotRemove/dhatch/rpmbuild
        % script # to log everything into typescript
        % cp -a SPECS/python.spec SPECS/python.spec.orig
        % rpmbuild -ba SPECS/python.spec
   bleah, takes a long time, mostly building docs

5. tweak SPECS/python.spec and do it again
        % vi SPECS/python.spec
            - changed lecl to lecl.valgrindfriendly in the version
            - add "--without-pymalloc" to the "configure" line
        % rpmbuild -ba SPECS/python.spec

6. install it on my machine!
        % cd /var/tmp/doNotRemove/dhatch/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64
        % sudo rpm -Uvh ./python2.6-2.6.4-lecl.valgrindfriendly.x86_64.rpm
            error: Failed dependencies:

        (that failed... better instructions are below)

INSTRUCTIONS:
    To install valgrind-friendly python2.6 (on rhel5):
        % cd /gtmp/superbee/doNotRemove/dhatch/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64
        % sudo rpm -Uvh ./*-2.6.4-lecl.valgrindfriendly.x86_64.rpm
    To revert to non-valgrind-friendly python2.6:
        % cd /gtmp/superbee/doNotRemove/dhatch/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64
        % sudo rpm -Uvh --oldpackage ./*-2.6.4-lecl.x86_64.rpm


7. Now to mess around...
   Just change stuff in the .c files, and type "make" in BUILD/Python-2.6.4.
   It helps to do the following in the top-level Makefile:
       - remove the "-DNDEBUG -O2"
   Tried this:
       - add -DPy_TRACE_REFS to CFLAGS
   but it didn't work, things failed with:
       ImportError: /usr/lib64/python2.6/lib-dynload/readline.so: undefined symbol: Py_InitModule4_64
