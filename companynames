Subject: company names?  org chart?

I know I'm weird, but for some reason it bugs me
to be calling the companies
by TLAs which have no connection in my mind to any words.
I've tried looking them up in loogie, but the only thing I ever found
was the performance appraisal form, which lists the following:

    Lucasfilm Ltd. (LFL)
    Industrial Light & Magic (ILM)
    Letterman Digital Arts (LDA)
    Lucasfilm Animation Limited (LAL)
    Lucasfilm Entertainment Company Limited (LECL)
    Skywalker Sound (SS)
    Skywalker Properties (SPL)
    Lucas Licensing (LIC)
    LucasArts (LEC)             (what does that stand for??) (LucasArts Entertainment Company, LLC? (that's what wikipedia says))
    JAK (?)

Is there a better, more definitive cheat sheet?
With the actual words that the letters stand for?
Maybe an org chart even?
