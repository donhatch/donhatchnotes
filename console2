NOTE:
    I think console2 has been obsoleted by ConEmu--
    ConEmu seems to be at least as good in every way
    I care about, and doesn't have some of the bugs of console2.

Notes about console2 (alternate cmd window for windows) from sourceforge

BUGS:
=====
- scrolling is fucked (just like cmd window and powershell_ise and others)
  til you have as many lines as the buffer.
  moving scrollbar to bottom should put bottom line at bottom of screen, always!!
- resizing from top causes bottom to be messed up, have to resize from bottom to fix (seems to be fixed in most recent source from git, 2011/10/19... or maybe just improved? or maybe not)
- maximize button is disabled (supposedly it's just uncommenting a line, but someone says it might be a bit buggy)
- history is insane just like the regular cmd window
      (is this a console thing, or a shell thing? it happens with both cmd and powershell)
- resizing the window doesn't send proper resize info to a vim session
  (it seems to hear something here and there but not much)
  (maybe it's good initially when resizing horizontally but breaks forevermore when resizing vertically)
- the "tree" command doesn't show box-drawing chars
- I want the scroll bar on the left!!!!! dammit!!
- settings dialog not expandable

- help is broken in version I downloaded,
  just gives an hourglass for a couple of seconds and then nothing, in version I built

My current settings:
============
        Edit -> Settings...
            Mouse
                was:
                    Copy/clear selection    Left
                    Select text             Shift-Left
                    Paste text              Middle
                changing to:
                    Copy/clear selection    None    (Clear and then Assign, or it won't take!)
                    Select text             Left
                    Paste text              Middle
                Assign
                check "save to user directory"
                OK
            Behavior
                check "copy on select"
                check "clear selection on copy"  (doesn't seem to work right unless I do this, argh)
            Hotkeys
                was:
                    Help              F1
                    Copy selection    Ctrl-Insert
                    Paste             Shift-Insert
                    Settings Dialog   Ctrl-S
                    Stop scrolling    None
                    Rename tab        Ctrl-R
                    Close tab         Ctrl-W
                changing to:
                    Help              Shift-F1          (I'd really like F1 to raise the window, since that's what I'm always hitting it for... is there a way? YES, make an AutoHotKey script)
                    Copy selection    Ctrl-Shift-c
                    Paste             Ctrl-Shift-v
                    Settings Dialog   Alt-S
                    Stop scrolling    Ctrl-S
                        (doesn't seem to be a "resume scrolling"? use Enter)
                    Rename tab        None   (Clear then Assign, or it won't take)
                    Close tab         None
                unchecked "Use Scroll Lock for scrolling"  (although I don't think it was functional anyway)
            Appearance
                change font from "courier new 10" to "terminal 9"  XXX argh! but that keeps changing to look like something else, every time someone installs something!?  now Lucida Console 9 is close, but not quite it... bold is too wide, non-bold is not bold enough
                messed with title options, I don't really understand them:
                        uncheck "use console window title"
                        check "Show command"
                        clear the title text entry
                    so now it honors setting window title in powershell:
                        $Host.UI.RawUI.WindowTitle = "my title"
                    (although it shows a "-" before my title, which is weird... this seems to be the best I can get)
            More...
                uncheck "show menu"
                uncheck "show toolbar"
                uncheck "show status bar"
                check "flat scrollbars" (doesn't take effect til restart, although it doesn't say that)
            Console
                Buffer size: was 500, changed to 10000
                Shell: (leave blank-- resist temptation to change it)


To make different shortcuts to run different shells in console:
    Edit -> Settings -> Tabs
        change first tab (make sure it's first!)
            name: powershell
            shell: powershell
        Add
            name: cmd
            shell: cmd
        Add
            name: git bash
            shell: C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin\bash.exe
        Add
            name: cygwin bash
            shell: C:\cygwin\bin\bash.exe
        Add
            name: cygwin tcsh
            shell: C:\cygwin\bin\tcsh.exe
then make the shortcut target something like this:
    C:\Users\dhatch\Desktop\Downloads\Console-2.00b147-Beta_32bit\Console2\Console.exe -t powershell
