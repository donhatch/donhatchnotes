Excerpt:
  A locale is composed of several locale categories, see Aspects. When a program looks up locale dependent values, it does this according to the following environment variables, in priority order:

    1. LANGUAGE
    2. LC_ALL
    3. LC_xxx, according to selected locale category: LC_CTYPE, LC_NUMERIC, LC_TIME, LC_COLLATE, LC_MONETARY, LC_MESSAGES, ...
    4. LANG

  ... see that page for more info (I included the above only for grepping purporses) ...

Rude surprises:

    $ LANG= date
    Tue Jun 11 13:26:43 PDT 2019
    $ echo $LANG
    en_US.UTF-8

  - $ echo $'a2b\na3b\na b' | sort
    a2b
    a3b
    a b
    $ echo $'a2b\na3b\na b' | LC_COLLATE=C sort
    a b
    a2b
    a3b
    $ echo $LC_COLLATE
        # empty
