ISSUE:
  Seems like the to-reproduce Makefile doesn't work any more.
  Need to add --no-as-needed?

  I think that's what this says:
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6411937/what-are-the-effects-of-linking-to-a-library-you-do-not-make-function-calls-to#answer-6412134

  Yeah, that works.
  And, be sure to put it *before* the relevant -l flags.

  Q: the `ld` man page implies --no-as-needed is the default, but it doesn't
     seem to be.  wtf?


After I do that:
  time ./main500 > /dev/null
    real        0m0.374s
  time ./main1000 > /dev/null
    real        0m2.865s
  time ./main2000 > /dev/null
    real        0m22.543s
  time ./main4000 > /dev/null
    real	3m18.744s
Yep, still O(n^3)
