iterm2 is a replacement for Terminal on macos.
I'm using iTerm2 because it seems to be more applescript-able than Terminal:
  https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-scripting.html


Non-obvious things:
 - Like Terminal, command-click does many terminal actions without raising
   or focusing the window.
   (But unlike Terminal, ctrl-alt-click doesn't focus-without-raising :-( ;
   see BUG below)
 - command-/ locates cursor-- cool!

My settings:
  - Prefs
    - General
      - Startup
        - change from "Use System Window Restoration Setting"
                   to "Only Restore Hotkey Window"
      - Closing
        - uncheck "confirm closing multiple sessions"
        - check "Quit when all windows closed"
      - Window
        - uncheck "Adjust window when changing font size"
           since the auto-adjust is unfriendly to all the other tabs
    - Appearance
      - Dimming
        - check "Dim inactive split panes"
        - check "Dim background windows"
      - Window
        - check "Show border around window"
    - Profiles
      - Default
        - Colors
          - Cursor Colors
            - check "Cursor Guide"
        - Notifications
          - Filter Alerts
            - uncheck 'Send "Bell" alert'
    - Pointer
      - check "^-Click reported to apps, does not open menu"
      - check "Focus follows mouse"

    - Advanced
      - Experimental Features
        - Use Metal GPU-based renderer -> Yes  (should be faster, but no transparency which I don't use anyway... and it says it may have other missing features)
      - Mouse
        - When Focus Follows Mouse is enabled,
         steal key focus even when inactive -> Yes
         NOTE: This is very nice-- it's almost full x-mouse, when iterm2
         is involved!!!
         Further steps would be (some of this making iterm2 into a window manager):
           - *relinquish* key focus to the other app under the cursor
             even when active.
           - manage that even among other pairs of apps
           - manage that even among pairs of windows of another app
           - hotkey to raise/lower iterm window (and it should work
             even if iterm is "inactive" but currently stealing focus)
           - and make *that* work even among other apps and among windows
             in another app
      - Session
        - Enable session restoration -> No


Q: can I set tab colors in applescript?

BUG: ctrl-alt-click doesn't focus-without-raise like Terminal does;
     instead, it's just like ctrl-click or right-click,
     i.e. it selects a word, raises the
     window, and brings up the right-click menu.
     And can't customize! :-(
     That is, left button (even modified) isn't one of the gestures
     I can customize in Prefs / Pointer / +;
     it says "You can't customize that button".
     Update:
     Actually can *partially* customize, as mentioned in xmouse notes:
     preferences -> Pointer -> check "^-click reported to apps, does not open menu".  The "does not open menu" part is desired, the "reported to apps" part is not!  (since that raises the window, dammit!)
     (Hmm, now that I discovered the "When Focus Follows Mouse is enabled, steal key focus even when inactive", I may not need this any more!)

Here's an Automator / "Run AppleScript" script I use to open 8 different tabs
with different text colors and different commands:

on run {input, parameters}
