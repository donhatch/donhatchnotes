iterm2 is a replacement for Terminal on macos.
I'm using iTerm2 because it seems to be more applescript-able than Terminal:
  https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-scripting.html


Non-obvious things:
 - Like Terminal, command-click does many terminal actions without raising
   or focusing the window.
   (But unlike Terminal, ctrl-alt-click doesn't focus-without-raising :-( ;
   see BUG below)
 - command-/ locates cursor-- cool!

My settings:
  - Prefs
    - General
      - Closing
        - uncheck "confirm closing multiple sessions"
        - check "Quit when all windows closed"
    - Appearance
      - Dimming
        - check "Dim inactive split panes"
        - check "Dim background windows"
      - Window
        - check "Show border around window"
    - Profiles
      - Default
        - Colors
          - Cursor Colors
            - check "Cursor Guide"
        - Notifications
          - Filter Alerts
            - uncheck 'Send "Bell" alert'
    - Pointer
      - check "Focus follows mouse"

Q: can I set tab colors in applescript?

BUG: ctrl-alt-click doesn't focus-without-raise like Terminal does;
     instead, it's just like ctrl-click or right-click,
     i.e. it selects a word, raises the
     window, and brings up the right-click menu.
     And can't customize! :-(
     That is, left button (even modified) isn't one of the gestures
     I can customize in Prefs / Pointer / +;
     it says "You can't customize that button".
     Update:
     Actually can *partially* customize, as mentioned in xmouse notes:
     preferences -> Pointer -> check "^-click reported to apps, does not open menu".  The "does not open menu" part is desired, the "reported to apps" part is not!  (since that raises the window, dammit!)

Here's an Automator / "Run AppleScript" script I use to open 8 different tabs
with different text colors and different commands:

on run {input, parameters}
