ConEmu is a console emulator,
seems to be as good as, or better than, console2
in all respects.
I found out about it from this:
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/60950/is-there-a-better-windows-console-window

Downloaded latest stable version 120727c [32]

Customizations (mostly to mimic normal console, minus bugs!):

    Right-click->Settings
        Main
            Font
                was: Lucida Console size=16
                changed to: Terminal size=12
                            (same as [Raster Fonts 8x12] I think)
        Size&Pos (child of Main)
            Width: 80  Height: 24
            (actually not quite sure what I did...
            the "Show&store current window size and position" thing is confusing)
        Features
            Miscellaneous options
                uncheck "Inject ConEmuHk" (keeps things from running slower, see below)
            Scrollbar
                Always show scrollbar   (beware confusing tri-state checkbox that I don't understand)
                Save settings (doesn't close dialog if Shift pressed)
        Text cursor (child of Features)
            uncheck "Blinking"
            Min size: change from 2 to 8
        Tabs (child of Features)
            uncheck "Enable Tabs"  (takes effect when Setting window closed and reopened)
        Status bar (child of Features)
            uncheck "Show status bar"
        Mark&Paste (child of Keys&Macro)
            changed selection Back color index from 14 (yellow) to 15 (white)
            change Text selection from "Left Shift" to "<Always>"
            change "Change prompt text cursor position with Left Click" from "<Always>" to "Left Shift"
                (although I don't know what that means
                 especially since this tri-state checkbox has no tooltip)
            uncheck "First line (default Ctrl+V)" since that interferes with ctrl-v in vim

            (note, double-clicking on a word seems to select it now,
            although it seemed like it didn't do that at first?? not sure
            if I did anything to make it do that)


Made 3 launchers:
In all 3 cases, drag ConEmu executable to launcher bar,
right click on it, and Start In: "c:/Users/hatch".
    - "cmd in ConEmu":
        target: "C:\Program Files (x86)\ConEmu\ConEmu.exe" /title cmd
    - "powershell in ConEmu":
        target: "C:\Program Files (x86)\ConEmu\ConEmu.exe" /title powershell /cmd powershell
    - "tcsh in ConEmu":
        target: "C:\Program Files (x86)\ConEmu\ConEmu.exe" /title tcsh /cmd "c:\cygwin\bin\tcsh"


Q: with above customizations... is it as good as console2 in all ways?  I think so.

Q: wait a minute, a lot of commands are slower to start!
   e.g. here are timings using console2 or usual console,
   vs. in ConEmu:
   'python -c "print 0"'  .13   .3
   /bin/echo foo          .02   .21
   so, all executed children have an overhead of .2 secs?  that's not good :-(
   Is it something to do with the Info/Debug thing?  I.e. are we effectively running a debugger?
A: it's a faq... he doesn't know exactly why, but it's fixable by:
    uncheck "Inject ConEmuHk" on Features page-- fixed it!
Q: procexp says:
    ConEmu.exe
        ConEmuC64.exe
            cmd.exe
                tcsh.exe
   how do I get rid of the cmd.exe in the middle?
   hmm, interesting, can just kill it in procexp, it disappears... but doesn't seem
   to hurt anything
   Note that ConEmu's Settings/Info/Debug window shows subprocesses too
   (actually they show up in procexp, but they don't show up as children of the tcsh
   so it's hard to keep track of them)

Q: how to set initial title?

Q: how to copy/paste? (want QuickEdit mode or something)



Console2 problems that aren't problems in ConEmu:
    - windows resize well (doesn't have console2's bug where it sometimes
      gets in a bad state if you resize from anywhere but bottom edge)
    - maximize button works!
    - woohoo! supports BOTH block selection (for the 1/1000 of the times I want it)
      (Left Alt) and Text selection (I changed from Left Shift to <Always>)!
    - ctrl-q properly resumes scrolling after stopped with ctrl-s
    - "tree" command actually shows the box-drawing characters!
Other observations:
    - selection still doesn't stay highlighted
    - double-clicking selects a word, but then dragging doesn't extend the selection properly
    - still can't put scrollbar on left :-)
    - bug in language:  "Leave on close" should be "Stay on close"
    - is /cmd arg flaky?  I thought the first time I tried it, it started two tabs, one with /cmd and the other with tcsh ...
      but it seems to be working better now.  (I think it's optional if nothing but the command is given, or something?)
    - /title works, but isn't mentioned in "About"
    - does the About dialog REALLY need to be modal???
    - can't see what default settings are without hitting Reset...
      but that actually saves the Reset settings, it shouldn't have to do that, should it?
