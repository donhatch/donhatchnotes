ConEmu is a console emulator,
seems to be as good as, or better than, console2
in all respects.

I found out about it from this:

Downloaded latest stable version 120727c [32]
(per bug report 1004, /log4 added in build 130411 so upgraded to 130425)

Customizations (mostly to mimic normal console, minus bugs!):

    Right-click->Settings
        Main
            Font
                was: Lucida Console size=16
                changed to: Terminal size=12
                            (same as [Raster Fonts 8x12] I think)
                and set width to 8 instead of 0
                    (doesn't have any immediate apparent effect,
                    but prevents the font from getting fucked up
                    and changing to width 6 or so
                    when I log out and back in without rebooting...
                    note this problem happens in console2 too,
                    but I don't know how to fix it there)
        Size&Pos (child of Main)
            Width: 80  Height: 24
            (actually not quite sure what I did...
            the "Show&store current window size and position" thing is confusing)
        Features
            Miscellaneous options
                uncheck "Inject ConEmuHk" (keeps things from running slower, see below)
            Scrollbar
                Always show scrollbar   (beware confusing tri-state checkbox that I don't understand)
                Save settings (doesn't close dialog if Shift pressed)
        Text cursor (child of Features)
            uncheck "Blinking"
            Min size: change from 2 to 8
        Colors (child of Features)
            uncheck "Fade when inactive"
        Tabs (child of Features)
            uncheck "Enable Tabs"  (takes effect when Setting window closed and reopened)
        Status bar (child of Features)
            uncheck "Show status bar"
        Mark&Paste (child of Keys&Macro)
            changed selection Back color index from 14 (yellow) to 15 (white)
            change Text selection from "Left Shift" to "<Always>"
            change "Change prompt text cursor position with Left Click" from "<Always>" to "Left Shift"
                (although I don't know what that means
                 especially since this tri-state checkbox has no tooltip)
            uncheck "First line (default Ctrl+V)" since that interferes with ctrl-v in vim
            uncheck "Confirm <Enter> paste"
            uncheck "Confirm pasting more than"

            (note, double-clicking on a word seems to select it now,
            although it seemed like it didn't do that at first?? not sure
            if I did anything to make it do that)


Made 3 launchers:
In all 3 cases, drag ConEmu executable to launcher bar,
right click on it, and Start In: "c:/Users/hatch".
    - "cmd in ConEmu":
        target: "C:\Program Files (x86)\ConEmu\ConEmu.exe" /title cmd
    - "powershell in ConEmu":
        target: "C:\Program Files (x86)\ConEmu\ConEmu.exe" /title powershell /cmd powershell
    - "tcsh in ConEmu":
        target: "C:\Program Files (x86)\ConEmu\ConEmu.exe" /title tcsh /cmd "c:\cygwin\bin\tcsh"


Q: I lost track of how to bring up Settings
   (I think I changed some shortcuts)... how do I get it?
A: left-click on icon on left side of title bar

Q: with above customizations... is it as good as console2 in all ways?  I think so.
A: no, it slows down and I have to restart all of them several times
   a day :-(
   Q: is that still true using latest alpha? (130708 x86)

Q: wait a minute, a lot of commands are slower to start!
   e.g. here are timings using console2 or usual console,
   vs. in ConEmu:
   'python -c "print 0"'  .13   .3
   /bin/echo foo          .02   .21
   so, all executed children have an overhead of .2 secs?  that's not good :-(
   Is it something to do with the Info/Debug thing?  I.e. are we effectively running a debugger?
A: it's a faq... he doesn't know exactly why, but it's fixable by:
    uncheck "Inject ConEmuHk" on Features page-- fixed it!
    oh! latest alpha (130708 x86) doesn't seem to have that problem! yay!

Q: procexp says:
    ConEmu.exe
        ConEmuC64.exe
            cmd.exe
                tcsh.exe
   how do I get rid of the cmd.exe in the middle?
   hmm, interesting, can just kill it in procexp, it disappears... but doesn't seem
   to hurt anything
   Note that ConEmu's Settings/Info/Debug window shows subprocesses too
   (actually they show up in procexp, but they don't show up as children of the tcsh
   so it's hard to keep track of them)

Q: how to set initial title?

Q: how to copy/paste? (want QuickEdit mode or something)

Q: do I want the x68 one or the x64 one?
PA: doing the x86 one for now




Console2 problems that aren't problems in ConEmu:
    - windows resize well (doesn't have console2's bug where it sometimes
      gets in a bad state if you resize from anywhere but bottom edge)
    - maximize button works!
    - woohoo! supports BOTH block selection (for the 1/1000 of the times I want it)
      (Left Alt) and Text selection (I changed from Left Shift to <Always>)!
    - ctrl-q properly resumes scrolling after stopped with ctrl-s
    - "tree" command actually shows the box-drawing characters!
    - ooh nice, ctrl-win-alt-space toggls showing the RealConsole!
      (but see the faq, they say it's flakey and sometimes you have to hit space again)
Awesome things:
    - ooh it can do more colors than other consoles? see:
          https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/wiki/Screenshots
          https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/wiki/AnsiEscapeCodes
            seems to be a bit flakey though...
                TCSH: ONLY the 16 normal colors come out
                    cat "c:/Program Files (x86)/ConEmu/ConEmu/Addons/AnsiColors256.ans"
                cmd: comes out good, but turns flakey after scrolling
                    type "c:\Program Files (x86)\ConEmu\ConEmu\Addons\AnsiColors256.ans"
                powershell: all colors come out, but lots of artifacts
                    (needs ConEmuHk.dll in order to work at all)
    - progress! applies heuristics to put progress in the task bar icon
      (e.g. run chkdsk and watch it)
BUGS:
    - "Terminal" font changes appearance on log-out-and-in without reboot:
      its width changes to effectively 6 or so.
      Changing it from 0 to 8 in Settings seems to prevent this.


    - pasting large things doesn't work at all?
        tried the script in http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/20996-auto-raise-mouse-hover/ , it didn't work
    - title '' sets the title to "ConEmu 130425 [32]" --
      I want it to be a blank string!
    - do NOT use the (undocumented?) /title option!
      - it prevents "title" from working
      - if there are several consoles up, they will start dropping keystrokes
      - if lots of them are up, the system becomes unusable
      this is being tracked as:
       https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/issues/detail?id=1004
     

Other observations:
    - still can't type while a process is spewing, to get blank lines the way I like
    - selection still doesn't stay highlighted
    - double-clicking selects a word, but then dragging doesn't extend the selection properly
    - still can't put scrollbar on left :-)
    - bug in language:  "Leave on close" should be "Stay on close" (wait the whole thing might have been rearranged... was this the "Task bar" tab? maybe no longer a problem, although I have no idea what "Quit on close (e.g. caption bar cross clicking)" means)
    - is /cmd arg flaky?  I thought the first time I tried it, it started two tabs, one with /cmd and the other with tcsh ...
      but it seems to be working better now.  (I think it's optional if nothing but the command is given, or something?)
    - can't see what default settings are without hitting Reset...
      but that actually saves the Reset settings, it shouldn't have to do that, should it?
    - does the About dialog REALLY need to be modal???
    - and non-resizeable?? (ResizeEnable fixes that)
    - settings dialog is not resizeable (maybe it doesn't need to be? hmm)




WARNING: Stay away from the /title option!!!!
I added the following to
https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/issues/detail?id=1004
=================================================
This happens for me too (on windows vista).

This took a long time for me to realize,
but I believe it only happens for me
if there is *another* ConEmu running,
and the other ConEmu was started using the (undocumented?) /title command-line option.
(And, the more "ConEmu /title" processes are running,
the more likely the problem is to happen.)

/log4 output is elusive (since when the problem would happen,
the logs get flooded and the program becomes unresponsive),
but I can tell you this:

- If I run "ConEmu /log4", it is responsive (though slow) and the problem doesn't happen.
  But if, while it's running,
  I start a separate "ConEmu /title hello",
  the first (logged) ConEmu becomes unresponsive,
  its ConEmu-gui.log file (in the Desktop/ConEmuLogs/ directory)
  starts getting flooded with the following:
        12:40:23.214 MsgC02B(49195): HWND=x0019050E, W=x00000006, L=x001D0434
        12:40:23.248 MsgC02B(49195): HWND=x0019050E, W=x00000006, L=x001D0434

        12:40:23.359 MsgC02B(49195): HWND=x0019050E, W=x00000006, L=x000D0480

        12:40:23.426 MsgC02B(49195): HWND=x0019050E, W=x00000006, L=x001D0434
  for as long as the second ConEmu exists,
  and even for several minutes after the second ConEmu exits.
  (I think the longer the second ConEmu has been running,
  the longer it takes for the flood to stop after it exits.)

- If I run "ConEmu /title hello /log4", it never gets to the prompt--
  the ConEmu-gui.log file shows an apparently infinite flood of mostly the following:
        12:45:54.502 Msg00AE(174): HWND=x0020050E, W=x00000008, L=x00000000

- Inside a "ConEmu /title hello", the "title" command doesn't work!
  But inside a ConEmu that was started without /title, the title command
  works fine (and doesn't trigger any problem in other ConEmu processes).

- If I run a dozen "ConEmu /title hello"s at once,
  my computer slows way down and becomes very unpleasant to work on,
  and procexp says "Desktop Window Manager" is taking up 25%-35% of a cpu.

The moral seems to be:
don't use the /title option!
(But then, is there any way to set the initial title?
I guess I can set an environment variable to my desired title,
and then make my shell startup file notice that
and run the "title" command appropriately...
is there a simpler way?)
