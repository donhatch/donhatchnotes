Very cool things:
    ctrl-shift-I: developer tools
    ctrl-shift-J: javascript console (just developer tools opened to that tab)



Q: can I customize some styles? (link colors and stuff)
A:  on windows vista:
        ~/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User\ Data/Default/User\ StyleSheets/Custom.css
    for example:
        A:link { color: #80a0ff ! important }
        A:hover { color: #ffff00 ! important }
        A:visited { color: #a000ff ! important }
    when the file is changed, displayed pages change instantly.


Q: is there a keyboard shortcut to open the link in a new tab?
   various sites say ctrl-shift-left but it doesn't work.

Q: how do I change the font size when printing?
   it prints teeny tiny and I want to make it bigger.

Q: can I set up some custom thing
   in which tabs are arranged in a tree view,
   with pages arranged under where they started from,
   and I can move them around and delete subtrees etc.?
   that would be kind of cool

Q: how do I tell which tab is using cpu?
A: Tools -> Task Manager

Q: how do I tell which tab is using memory?
PA: (still not sure exactly how to use it usually)
    chrome://memory
    https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/heap-profiling

Q: how do I disable the Predictions url drop-down?
   I would like to set it so there's no drop-down ever.
PA: menu -> settings -> Show advanced settings...
       -> Privacy -> "use a prediction service"
       uncheck it.
   woops, does not work.
   I don't think there's a way?
   even though it takes up
   half the screen on android??
   I don't think it can be done :-(

Q: how do I get chrome to forget links I've visited?
   the following doesn't do it:
       History -> Clear browsing data... -> obliterate everything
A: oh hmm, actually I think it's completing
   based on bookmarks.  I'd have to remove the bookmarks too.
