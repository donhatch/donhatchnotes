Questions about chrome:

Q: what's that chrome request debugger?
PA: well there's an extension called HTTP Trace: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/http-trace/idladlllljmbcnfninpljlkaoklggknp/related?hl=en-US
    And mine works pretty well: webRequestExample
      https://github.com/donhatch/chromeWebRequestExample
    Currently have to edit source to change params though.


Q: close a tab?
A: ctrl-w (linux), cmd-w (mac)
Q: close a window?
A: ctrl-shift-w (linux), cmd-shift-w (mac)
Q: find/find-next?
A: ctrl-f/ctrl-g (linux), cmd-f/cmd-g (mac)
Q: dup current page in new tab?
A: right click on tab -> duplicate, or:
       linux: alt-d (to focus address bar), alt-enter (to open it in a new tab)
       mac: cmd-l cmd-enter (background)   or cmd-l cmd-shift-enter (foreground)
Q: next tab?
A: ctrl-tab
Q: prev tab?
A: ctrl-shift-tab
Q: reopen last tab I've closed?
A: ctrl-shift-t (remembers last 10)

Q: exit? (on linux there's an exit menu item, or shift-ctrl-q, but what about mac?)
PA:
    apparently there's no way to graceful exit, even in the chrome Task Manager window.
    close all windows then Apple->Force Quit.  what the fuck???
A: oh! command-q does it!  not available in any menu???
Q: but I really want it to ask for confirmation. how?
   there's lots of web conversation on this... apparently the feature appeared then disappeared lots of times?
   my chrome on the mac is version 30.0.1599.101

Q: I can't log in to stackoverflow--
   my usual way is to do it through my google login
   but it's using donhatch@google.com -- I guess somehow I'm "logged in" to that
   in some sense and I don't know how to log it out??
A: get into gmail and sign out there (click on drop-down that shows my name)

Q: in the Developer Tools -> Network -> Filter,
   how do you control it??
   - most of the time it won't let me type into it
      (maybe move the mouse out and then back in the window?)
   - how do I select everything with "lyrs" or "mapslt" in it?

Q: when I execute google-chrome (or google-chrome-beta) from command line,
   it always says "Created new window in existing browser session.",
   but sometimes it actually creates a new window and sometimes
   just a new tab.
   sometimes I want a new window; sometimes I want a new tab.
   Is there any way to control which of the two things happens?
PA: looks like if there's a ":" in the url it opens a new window!?
   so don't to that.

Q: vim hotkey to open cs to the right place?
   maybe *?
   possible resources which aren't panning out yet:
     https://sites.google.com/a/google.com/codesearch/Home/users-manual?pli=1#TOC-...-vim
     https://sites.google.com/a/google.com/codesearch/faq
   Let's see, the search would be something like:
       google-chrome-beta "https://cs/#search/&q=file:geo/vectordb/util/geometry/bottom_up_geometry_tiler.cc"
   or just the following which gets converted to it:
       google-chrome-beta "https://cs/?q=file:geo/vectordb/util/geometry/bottom_up_geometry_tiler.cc"
   oh bleah! but if I add &l=123, it gets lost in translation...
   bleah!
   oh wait, this works:
     google-chrome-beta "https://cs/#search&q=geo/vectordb/util/geometry/bottom_up_geometry_tiler.cc:123"
   as does this:
     google-chrome-beta "https://cs/?q=geo/vectordb/util/geometry/bottom_up_geometry_tiler.cc:123"

   so here's a decent map (the "silent" and <C-l> avoid the "Press ENTER or type command to continue":
       :map * :silent !google-chrome-beta "https://cs/?q=geo/vectordb/util/geometry/bottom_up_geometry_tiler.cc:123" \| grep -v "Created new window in existing browser session." &<CR><C-l>
   and to get the real file and line number in there:
       :map * :exe 'silent !google-chrome-beta "https://cs/?q=%:'.line(".").'" \| grep -v "Created new window in existing browser session." &'<CR><C-l>
   (special chars in the file name could theoretically mess things up, but this seems unlikely to happen)

Q: argh! if I've inserted stuff so that line number is > original file size, the search fails! in that case I'd like it to just go to the end, I think

Q: how to restart chrome, recreating all tabs and windows?
A: chrome://restart






===================================================================
exploring redirects

When I type http://google.com into my browser and hit Enter:
    The Developer Tools console Network tab shows this:
        http://google.com/ returned 301 Moved Permanently, to...
        http://www.google.com/ returned 302 Found (aka Moved Temporarily) to...
        https://www.google.com/ returned 200 ok
    The Redirect Path extension concurs.
    History shows:
        https://www.google.com/ DAMN!
I was hoping... oh! Looks like there's another one: 307,
which maybe puts original Request-URI in the history?
    10.3.8 307 Temporary Redirect

    The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. Since the redirection MAY be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD continue to use the Request-URI for future requests. This response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field.

    The temporary URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s) , since many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not understand the 307 status. Therefore, the note SHOULD contain the information necessary for a user to repeat the original request on the new URI.

    If the 307 status code is received in response to a request other than GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might change the conditions under which the request was issued.


All right how do I test this???
Need to set up a server
that does a 307 redirect...
Oh, this page has it already:
        http://jigsaw.w3.org/HTTP/300/Overview.html
Damn! it doesn't work!
======================================================================


Okay, strategy for trying to get original URL in:
      - global history
      - page reload history (or maybe cascading menu, so each entry knows its redirect chain? that would be great)
      - back button history
      - the url bar itself (or maybe right-click menu with option to get any of the redirect chain? that would be great)
    when a redirect happens:
        if the page that initiated the redirect was not itself initiated by a redirect
            put the initiating page in the history.
        example:
              http://go/who                  302 Found (initiator: Other)
              https://goto.google.com/who    302 Found (initiator: http://go/who Redirect)
              http://googlewho.appspot.com/  302 Found (initiator: https://goto.google.com/who Redirect)
              https://googlewho.appspot.com/ 302 Found (initiator: http://googlewho.appspot.com/ Redirect)
              https://teams/googleplex.com/  200 OK    (initiator: https://googlewho.appspot.com/ Redirect)
        in this case we'd want to add http://go/who to the history (back button?) so it doesn't get lost.
        another example:
          http://bns/ih/borg/ih/bns/cartewheel-eng/dev-donhatch.processing_servers.workertaskservers/0/statusz                  302
          https://bns/ih/borg/ih/bns/cartewheel-eng/dev-donhatch.processing_servers.workertaskservers/0/statusz                 302
          http://ihbne9.prod.google.com:25362/statusz                                                                           200
        another example:
          http://0.dev-donhatch.processing_servers.workertaskservers.cartewheel-eng.ih.borg.google.com/statusz       302
          http://0.dev-donhatch.processing_servers.workertaskservers.cartewheel-eng.ih.borg.google.com:25362/statusz 200


And... strategy for tracing redirects that are happening
during cartewheel?
Hmm, it says initiator was Other,
and does not look like it's coming from a redirect.  Where the hell is it coming from???

And strategy for more intelligent redirecting if possible?

Also to look into:  "meta refresh", which apparently does a redirect without clobbering back button history (but it has an annoying delay)


Older material (should merge with the above at some point)
=============================================================================
http://reviews.cnet.co.uk/software-and-web-apps/50-essential-chrome-tips-50008273/

Very cool things:
    ctrl-shift-I: developer tools
    ctrl-shift-J: javascript console (just developer tools opened to that tab)



Q: can I customize some styles? (link colors and stuff)
A:  on windows vista:
        ~/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User\ Data/Default/User\ StyleSheets/Custom.css
    for example:
        A:link { color: #80a0ff ! important }
        A:hover { color: #ffff00 ! important }
        A:visited { color: #a000ff ! important }
    when the file is changed, displayed pages change instantly.

Q: is there a keyboard shortcut to open the link in a new tab?
   various sites say ctrl-shift-left but it doesn't work.

Q: how do I change the font size when printing?
   it prints teeny tiny and I want to make it bigger.

Q: can I set up some custom thing
   in which tabs are arranged in a tree view,
   with pages arranged under where they started from,
   and I can move them around and delete subtrees etc.?
   that would be kind of cool

Q: how do I tell which tab is using cpu?
A: Tools -> Task Manager

Q: how do I tell which tab is using memory?
PA: (still not sure exactly how to use it usually)
    chrome://memory
    https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/heap-profiling

Q: how do I disable the Predictions url drop-down?
   I would like to set it so there's no drop-down ever.
PA: menu -> settings -> Show advanced settings...
       -> Privacy -> "use a prediction service"
       uncheck it.
   woops, does not work.
   I don't think there's a way?
   even though it takes up
   half the screen on android??
   I don't think it can be done :-(
   See this if serious: http://blog.techprognosis.com/2011/07/08/privacy-how-to-lock-down-googles-chrome-browser.html


Q: how do I get chrome to forget links I've visited?
   the following doesn't do it:
       History -> Clear browsing data... -> obliterate everything
A: oh hmm, actually I think it's completing
   based on bookmarks.  I'd have to remove the bookmarks too.



EXTENSIONS:

Q: how do I make a user script?
A: make a chrome extension

Q: on redirect, the url in the url bar gets rewritten
   and there's no way to get back to the original robust url.
   Any way to make life easier?
PA:
   read and understand this flow chart:
   https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/webRequest
   http://www.adambarth.com/experimental/crx/docs/webRequest.html

   and this maybe, although it's the opposite of what I want,
   when I understand it all maybe I will be able to answer the question
   https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/switcheroo-redirector/cnmciclhnghalnpfhhleggldniplelbg
   (installed it, it's good for some other things)

Q: why are my extensions hidden behind a menu?  I want Clear Cache or Cache Killer to be an always-visible button.
A: OH! drag the lhs of the address bar to the left, they will appear!!
   (someone was complaining they don't stick if you exit chrome and start again, but they seem to)

Q: can I put the extension browser-action icons on a row below the address bar?
   there are too many of them and it's making the address bar too small :-(

Ideas for extensions:
    - on redirect, put original url in history (instead of, or in addition to, the new one)?
        - maybe, use chrome.webRequest (or beta chrome.declarativeWebRequest?) to intercept every request,
          and put it in history immediately before it turns into a redirect?
        (check out Redirector, maybe does what I want? has regexes etc.)
        (OH NO it's gone??? 
        (installed "Redirect path" which is a good viewer for exactly what the redirect path is...
           it can be long! e.g. go/who)

    - substitute patterns, like switcheroo does, using chrome.webRequest api, but,
        - less unusable ui (maybe no ui, just file configuration and a reload button?)
        - regexes, duh (Regex Search)
        - restrict context, e.g. only do it on urls generated by a page whose url matches some other regex

    - very quick "clear cache" button
        see chrome://cache or about://cache (same thing I think)
        there are some existing extensions:
            Clear Cache (I think this might be it... pretty configurable)
            Click&Clean (nice but takes some extra clicks)
            Cache Killer (try this one too... when enabled, automatically clears cache before loading a page)
      But what I really want is the ability to have custom buttons
      that do various custom combinations of things,
      so that I don't have to get derailed by changing settings
      and then forgetting to change them back.
        - everything
        - cookies only
        - caches only
        - cookies and caches only
      maybe times various times too? hmm

    See here:
        http://www.bigspaceship.com/chrome-extensions-are-good-for-you/
        https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted

Q: where do extensions live?
A: 
    linux: ~/.config/google-chrome-beta/Default/Extensions
    mac: ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions
  Q: what about settings?

Q: What do I have to clear to get it to not autosuggest
   links I've visited?
A: History -> Clear browsing data... -> Browsing history (and maybe download history).
   Or, in "Clear Cache" extension, check "History".
   Note however that the autosuggest drop-down
   also looks at bookmarks!  So if you really don't want any dropdowns,
   you'd have to remove all your bookmarks.

Q: I know an extension can't have multiple icons.
   But I'd like two readily accessible buttons:
    1. "Clear App Cache and Cache"
    2. "Clear App Cache, Cache, and Cookies".
   Having to switch the Clear Cache options back and forth just sucks!

A:
  Strategy 1: Make 1 or more copies of the Clear Cache extension,
   with separate icon and options for each.
     [is the source available?]
     [can just copy the dir, change the version, and reload it?]
     [bleah! how to make it appear separately?]
     [too hard :-( ]

  Strategy 2: Make two very simple special purpose extensions,
   with distinguishable icons, that do exactly the two actions I want.
   Maybe:
        Clear Cache icon with an exclamation point
        Clear Cache icon with two exclamation points
     [The "Delete All Cookies From Javascript" extension might
      be a good reference.]

  Strategy 3: Enhance Clear Cache extension to support configurable
   entries in the right-click menu.
   The options page should allow editing them:
        - rename an entry
        - clone an entry
        - add an entry (or maybe just clone?)
        - delete an entry (unless it's the default one)
        - swap order of two entries (or move entry left/right earlier/later)
        - show/hide entry in menu
        - different keyboard shortcuts for different entries
    [Yow! Way too ambitious.]
