Questions about chrome:

Q: what's that chrome request debugger?
PA: well there's an extension called HTTP Trace: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/http-trace/idladlllljmbcnfninpljlkaoklggknp/related?hl=en-US
    And mine works pretty well: webRequestExample
      https://github.com/donhatch/chromeWebRequestExample
    Currently have to edit source to change params though.


Q: close a tab?
A: ctrl-w (linux), cmd-w (mac)
Q: close a window?
A: ctrl-shift-w (linux), cmd-shift-w (mac)
Q: find/find-next?
A: ctrl-f/ctrl-g (linux), cmd-f/cmd-g (mac)
Q: dup current page in new tab?
A: right click on tab -> duplicate, or:
       linux: alt-d (to focus address bar), alt-enter (to open it in a new tab)
       mac: cmd-l cmd-enter (background)   or cmd-l cmd-shift-enter (foreground)
Q: next tab?
A: ctrl-tab
Q: prev tab?
A: ctrl-shift-tab
Q: reopen last tab I've closed?
A: ctrl-shift-t (remembers last 10)

Q: exit? (on linux there's an exit menu item, or shift-ctrl-q, but what about mac?)
PA:
    apparently there's no way to graceful exit, even in the chrome Task Manager window.
    close all windows then Apple->Force Quit.  what the fuck???
A: oh! command-q does it!  not available in any menu???
Q: but I really want it to ask for confirmation. how?
   there's lots of web conversation on this... apparently the feature appeared then disappeared lots of times?
   my chrome on the mac is version 30.0.1599.101

Q: I can't log in to stackoverflow--
   my usual way is to do it through my google login
   but it's using donhatch@google.com -- I guess somehow I'm "logged in" to that
   in some sense and I don't know how to log it out??
A: get into gmail and sign out there (click on drop-down that shows my name)

Q: in the Developer Tools -> Network -> Filter,
   how do you control it??
   - most of the time it won't let me type into it
      (maybe move the mouse out and then back in the window?)
   - how do I select everything with "lyrs" or "mapslt" in it?

Q: when I execute google-chrome (or google-chrome-beta) from command line,
   it always says "Created new window in existing browser session.",
   but sometimes it actually creates a new window and sometimes
   just a new tab.
   sometimes I want a new window; sometimes I want a new tab.
   Is there any way to control which of the two things happens?
PA: looks like if there's a ":" in the url it opens a new window!?
   so don't to that.

Q: how to open something from command line, to an *existing* window/tab?
   (e.g. I regenerated a file and I want to make it refresh, from command line)
PA: seems like it's not supported.

    Q: what's a decent workaround?  an extension to help? a wrapper page
     to auto refresh the page on file change?  Or just every 5 seconds or so?
    PA: ooh someone has a hack that might work!
        http://razius.com/articles/auto-refreshing-google-chrome-on-file-changes/
        Bleah, can't seem to get xdotool to send keystrokes to chrome windows for some reason?
        Oh!  Just need to run "xdotool windowactivate 0x5c0002d" before the other.
        Still, pretty fragile.
    PA: I'm trying the "Super Auto Refresh Plus" extension.
        Ooh it's nice, it has a countdown timer in the extension icon!  Cool!
        Things I don't like:
        - It keeps updating even when the tab isn't visible
          Verified by putting this inside the html:
           <script> console.log("LOADING! "+new Date().toString()); </script>
        - timing isn't right.  I'd like it to do the following, solidly:
            3<1sec>2<1sec>1<1sec>bam! blank for a moment while it refreshes, then come back with 3<1sec>2<1sec> etc.
          Instead, it updates flakily, sometimes showing the 3 and sometimes not, sometimes showing 0 and sometimes not, sometimes showing the final 1 for half a second and then disappearing.

        Let's see, can I do a poor man's version of this?
        I can do this from the console once:
          (()=>{
              console.log("5...");
              document.title = "5...";
              setTimeout(()=>{
                  console.log("4...");
                  document.title = "4...";
                  setTimeout(()=>{
                      console.log("3...");
                      document.title = "3...";
                      setTimeout(()=>{
                          console.log("2...");
                          document.title = "2...";
                          setTimeout(()=>{
                              console.log("1...");
                              document.title = "1...";
                              setTimeout(()=>{
                                console.log("RELOADING!");
                                document.title = "0!!!!!";
                                window.location.reload(true);
                                console.log("RELOADED!");
                                setTimeout(()=>{
                                    console.log("haHA!");  // this never comes out
                                    document.title = "haHA!";  // this never comes out
                                }, 1000);
                              }, 1000);
                          }, 1000);
                      }, 1000);
                  }, 1000);
              }, 1000);
          })();
        Or, put it in a <script> in the file and it gets repeated.  Cool.
        So then can I set some extension title to it?
        It *does* have somewhat flaky timing, though... the console messages are responsive, the tab title change
        lags behind by a quarter second or so.
        Interesting to note: if I switch to another tab, that one's countdowns slow down to about half speed!

        Rewriting using a promise:

        (()=>{
          const delay = ms => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
          console.log("5...");
          document.title = "5...";
          delay(1000).then(()=>{
            console.log("4...");
            document.title = "4...";
            return delay(1000);
          }).then(()=>{
            console.log("3...");
            document.title = "3...";
            return delay(1000);
          }).then(()=>{
            console.log("2...");
            document.title = "2...";
            return delay(1000);
          }).then(()=>{
            console.log("1...");
            document.title = "1...";
            return delay(1000);
          }).then(()=>{
            console.log("RELOADING!");
            document.title = "0!!!!!";
            window.location.reload(true);
            console.log("RELOADED!");
            return delay(1000);
          }).then(()=>{
            console.log("haHA!");  // this never comes out
            document.title = "haHA!";  // this never comes out
          });
        })();




Q: vim hotkey to open cs to the right place?
   maybe *?
   possible resources which aren't panning out yet:
     https://sites.google.com/a/google.com/codesearch/Home/users-manual?pli=1#TOC-...-vim
     https://sites.google.com/a/google.com/codesearch/faq
   Let's see, the search would be something like:
       google-chrome-beta "https://cs/#search/&q=file:geo/vectordb/util/geometry/bottom_up_geometry_tiler.cc"
   or just the following which gets converted to it:
       google-chrome-beta "https://cs/?q=file:geo/vectordb/util/geometry/bottom_up_geometry_tiler.cc"
   oh bleah! but if I add &l=123, it gets lost in translation...
   bleah!
   oh wait, this works:
     google-chrome-beta "https://cs/#search&q=geo/vectordb/util/geometry/bottom_up_geometry_tiler.cc:123"
   as does this:
     google-chrome-beta "https://cs/?q=geo/vectordb/util/geometry/bottom_up_geometry_tiler.cc:123"

   so here's a decent map (the "silent" and <C-l> avoid the "Press ENTER or type command to continue":
       :map * :silent !google-chrome-beta "https://cs/?q=geo/vectordb/util/geometry/bottom_up_geometry_tiler.cc:123" \| grep -v "Created new window in existing browser session." &<CR><C-l>
   and to get the real file and line number in there:
       :map * :exe 'silent !google-chrome-beta "https://cs/?q=%:'.line(".").'" \| grep -v "Created new window in existing browser session." &'<CR><C-l>
   (special chars in the file name could theoretically mess things up, but this seems unlikely to happen)

Q: argh! if I've inserted stuff so that line number is > original file size, the search fails! in that case I'd like it to just go to the end, I think

Q: how to restart chrome, recreating all tabs and windows?
A: chrome://restart

Q: can I change my "drag" cursor? the default one really sucks,
   it doesn't give me a feeling for where the pointer point is,
   and actually obscures it.






===================================================================
exploring redirects

When I type http://google.com into my browser and hit Enter:
    The Developer Tools console Network tab shows this:
        http://google.com/ returned 301 Moved Permanently, to...
        http://www.google.com/ returned 302 Found (aka Moved Temporarily) to...
        https://www.google.com/ returned 200 ok
    The Redirect Path extension concurs.
    History shows:
        https://www.google.com/ DAMN!
I was hoping... oh! Looks like there's another one: 307,
which maybe puts original Request-URI in the history?
    10.3.8 307 Temporary Redirect

    The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. Since the redirection MAY be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD continue to use the Request-URI for future requests. This response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field.

    The temporary URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s) , since many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not understand the 307 status. Therefore, the note SHOULD contain the information necessary for a user to repeat the original request on the new URI.

    If the 307 status code is received in response to a request other than GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might change the conditions under which the request was issued.


All right how do I test this???
Need to set up a server
that does a 307 redirect...
Oh, this page has it already:
        http://jigsaw.w3.org/HTTP/300/Overview.html
Damn! it doesn't work!
======================================================================


Okay, strategy for trying to get original URL in:
      - global history
      - page reload history (or maybe cascading menu, so each entry knows its redirect chain? that would be great)
      - back button history
      - the url bar itself (or maybe right-click menu with option to get any of the redirect chain? that would be great)
    when a redirect happens:
        if the page that initiated the redirect was not itself initiated by a redirect
            put the initiating page in the history.
        example:
              http://go/who                  302 Found (initiator: Other)
              https://goto.google.com/who    302 Found (initiator: http://go/who Redirect)
              http://googlewho.appspot.com/  302 Found (initiator: https://goto.google.com/who Redirect)
              https://googlewho.appspot.com/ 302 Found (initiator: http://googlewho.appspot.com/ Redirect)
              https://teams/googleplex.com/  200 OK    (initiator: https://googlewho.appspot.com/ Redirect)
        in this case we'd want to add http://go/who to the history (back button?) so it doesn't get lost.
        another example:
          http://bns/ih/borg/ih/bns/cartewheel-eng/dev-donhatch.processing_servers.workertaskservers/0/statusz                  302
          https://bns/ih/borg/ih/bns/cartewheel-eng/dev-donhatch.processing_servers.workertaskservers/0/statusz                 302
          http://ihbne9.prod.google.com:25362/statusz                                                                           200
        another example:
          http://0.dev-donhatch.processing_servers.workertaskservers.cartewheel-eng.ih.borg.google.com/statusz       302
          http://0.dev-donhatch.processing_servers.workertaskservers.cartewheel-eng.ih.borg.google.com:25362/statusz 200


And... strategy for tracing redirects that are happening
during cartewheel?
Hmm, it says initiator was Other,
and does not look like it's coming from a redirect.  Where the hell is it coming from???

And strategy for more intelligent redirecting if possible?

Also to look into:  "meta refresh", which apparently does a redirect without clobbering back button history (but it has an annoying delay)


Older material (should merge with the above at some point)
=============================================================================
http://reviews.cnet.co.uk/software-and-web-apps/50-essential-chrome-tips-50008273/

Very cool things:
    ctrl-shift-I: developer tools
    ctrl-shift-J: javascript console (just developer tools opened to that tab)



Q: can I customize some styles? (link colors and stuff)
A:  on windows vista:
        ~/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User\ Data/Default/User\ StyleSheets/Custom.css
    for example:
        A:link { color: #80a0ff ! important }
        A:hover { color: #ffff00 ! important }
        A:visited { color: #a000ff ! important }
    when the file is changed, displayed pages change instantly.

Q: is there a keyboard shortcut to open the link in a new tab?
   various sites say ctrl-shift-left but it doesn't work.

Q: how do I change the font size when printing?
   it prints teeny tiny and I want to make it bigger.

Q: can I set up some custom thing
   in which tabs are arranged in a tree view,
   with pages arranged under where they started from,
   and I can move them around and delete subtrees etc.?
   that would be kind of cool

Q: how do I tell which tab is using cpu?
A: Tools -> Task Manager

Q: how do I tell which tab is using memory?
PA: (still not sure exactly how to use it usually)
    chrome://memory
    https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/heap-profiling

Q: how do I disable the Predictions url drop-down?
   I would like to set it so there's no drop-down ever.
PA: menu -> settings -> Show advanced settings...
       -> Privacy -> "use a prediction service"
       uncheck it.
   woops, does not work.
   I don't think there's a way?
   even though it takes up
   half the screen on android??
   I don't think it can be done :-(
   See this if serious: http://blog.techprognosis.com/2011/07/08/privacy-how-to-lock-down-googles-chrome-browser.html


Q: how do I get chrome to forget links I've visited?
   the following doesn't do it:
       History -> Clear browsing data... -> obliterate everything
A: oh hmm, actually I think it's completing
   based on bookmarks.  I'd have to remove the bookmarks too.

Q: what tab managers do I like?
A:
  - Tab Outliner seems to be the most useful/intelligent, from what I've seen.
    Tips:
     - from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvlK1ttZ3dI "How to easily clean-up you browsing tree in Tabs Outliner":
       - use clone view to have 2 views, allows dragging between distant locations
       - instead of deleting, move things to a garbage pile; that's easier to retrieve something if put there accidenally.
    Bugs:
     - the fact that it says '?' gives help
       but then when you type ? it says "that's only available in paid mode"
       feels like a bit of an insult, like bait-and-switch.
     - it jumps when I shift focus to a different chrome window,
       even if whole tree fits on screen.  should never jump if whole tree
       fits on screen!  and I need it to avoid jumping wherever
       possible in general.
    Questions:
     Q: can I make it pop a window to the front?
  - Hey wait a minute-- is there something called "Tree Tabs"? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9AKiqhtMRQ
    Is it called "Sidewise Tree Style Tabs"?
    Hmm, installed that, it seems to be a bit flaky,
    but maybe just because it's fighting with Tab Outliner.  Disabled it.



EXTENSIONS:

Q: how do I customize the icon menu?
PA: maybe this is relevant: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19468429/add-contextmenu-items-to-a-chrome-extensions-browser-action-button

Q: what's the quickest way to reload an extension after modifying source code?
PA: hit ctrl-R in its background page, that will reload the background page, but not the manifest.
    To get the manifest, I think you need to do "Load unpacked" in the "Manage Extensions" (which means "Manage this extension") page?

Q: how do I make a user script?
A: make a chrome extension

Q: What are the differences among user scripts, content scripts, background scripts, injected scripts?
PA: see this answer, which covers extension code (background page, content scripts, injected scripts):
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9915311/chrome-extension-code-vs-content-scripts-vs-injected-scripts#answer-9916089
  However, it doesn't cover user scripts.

Q: on redirect, the url in the url bar gets rewritten
   and there's no way to get back to the original robust url.
   Any way to make life easier?
   (see other stuff about history in this doc, too.  have not got anyhthing working yet though, chrome.history.addUrl seems to be non-functional :-()
PA:
   read and understand this flow chart:
   https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/webRequest
   http://www.adambarth.com/experimental/crx/docs/webRequest.html

   and this maybe, although it's the opposite of what I want,
   when I understand it all maybe I will be able to answer the question
   https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/switcheroo-redirector/cnmciclhnghalnpfhhleggldniplelbg
   (installed it, it's good for some other things)

   Also some web pages rewrite the URL too, e.g. google maps... think about whether to fight or cooperate with that.

Q: why are my extensions hidden behind a menu?  I want Clear Cache or Cache Killer to be an always-visible button.
A: OH! drag the lhs of the address bar to the left, they will appear!!
   (someone was complaining they don't stick if you exit chrome and start again, but they seem to)

Q: can I put the extension browser-action icons on a row below the address bar?
   there are too many of them and it's making the address bar too small :-(

Q: I selected "Hide in chrome menu" for an extension.  How do I un-hide it?
A: it got moved to the top of the vertical ellipses icon menu over on the very right side.  Just drag it back.

Ideas for extensions:
    - on redirect, put original url in history (instead of, or in addition to, the new one)?
        - maybe, use chrome.webRequest (or beta chrome.declarativeWebRequest?) to intercept every request,
          and put it in history immediately before it turns into a redirect?
        (check out Redirector, maybe does what I want? has regexes etc.)
        (OH NO it's gone??? 
        (installed "Redirect path" which is a good viewer for exactly what the redirect path is...
           it can be long! e.g. go/who)
      (see other extensive thoughts on this elsewhere in this doc)

    - substitute patterns, like switcheroo does, using chrome.webRequest api, but,
        - less unusable ui (maybe no ui, just file configuration and a reload button?)
        - regexes, duh (Regex Search)
        - restrict context, e.g. only do it on urls generated by a page whose url matches some other regex

    - very quick "clear cache" button
        see chrome://cache or about://cache (same thing I think)
        there are some existing extensions:
            Clear Cache (I think this might be it... pretty configurable)
            Click&Clean (nice but takes some extra clicks)
            Cache Killer (try this one too... when enabled, automatically clears cache before loading a page)
      But what I really want is the ability to have custom buttons
      that do various custom combinations of things,
      so that I don't have to get derailed by changing settings
      and then forgetting to change them back.
        - everything
        - cookies only
        - caches only
        - cookies and caches only
      maybe times various times too? hmm

    See here:
        http://www.bigspaceship.com/chrome-extensions-are-good-for-you/
        https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted

Q: where do extensions live?
A: 
    linux: ~/.config/google-chrome-beta/Default/Extensions
        or: ~/.config/google-chrome-beta/Profile 1/Extensions/eogalmedmljabbaahganginmeabadfbp
    mac: ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions
  Q: what about settings?

Q: What do I have to clear to get it to not autosuggest
   links I've visited?
A: History -> Clear browsing data... -> Browsing history (and maybe download history).
   Or, in "Clear Cache" extension, check "History".
   Note however that the autosuggest drop-down
   also looks at bookmarks!  So if you really don't want any dropdowns,
   you'd have to remove all your bookmarks.

Q: I know an extension can't have multiple icons.
   But I'd like two readily accessible buttons:
    1. "Clear App Cache and Cache"
    2. "Clear App Cache, Cache, and Cookies".
   Having to switch the Clear Cache options back and forth just sucks!

A:
  Strategy 1: Make 1 or more copies of the Clear Cache extension,
   with separate icon and options for each.
     [is the source available?]
     [can just copy the dir, change the version, and reload it?]
     [bleah! how to make it appear separately?]
     [too hard :-( ]

  Strategy 2: Make two very simple special purpose extensions,
   with distinguishable icons, that do exactly the two actions I want.
   Maybe:
        Clear Cache icon with an exclamation point
        Clear Cache icon with two exclamation points
     [The "Delete All Cookies From Javascript" extension might
      be a good reference.]

  Strategy 3: Enhance Clear Cache extension to support configurable
   entries in the right-click menu.
   The options page should allow editing them:
        - rename an entry
        - clone an entry
        - add an entry (or maybe just clone?)
        - delete an entry (unless it's the default one)
        - swap order of two entries (or move entry left/right earlier/later)
        - show/hide entry in menu
        - different keyboard shortcuts for different entries
    [Yow! Way too ambitious.]

Q: pixels as little squares?
A: Use extension Stylish:
     make rule "Pixelated images and canvases",
       applies to: Everything
	  img, canvas {
	    image-rendering: pixelated;
	  }
   (Unfortunately doesn't seem to apply to file:// images,
   but can add it to the img's Styles in the dev console, temporarily.)
   (To really view an image file, make an html page with an img tag
   that refers to it)

   And use that CSS fragment in all web pages I care about.

Q: is there a good workflow for pinning tabs? e.g. mail, calendar...
PA: https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7264/make-google-chrome-open-with-pinned-tabs/
    hmm, have to manually open and pin, in each new window... I think? not sure.
    Hmm and there's supposedly Basics -> On tartup -> Open the following pages -> Open current pages

Q: how do I keep 2-finger-scroll from going forward and back on mac?  I hate it!
A: System Preferences -> Trackpad -> More Gestures -> "Swipe between pages: Scroll left or right with two fingers" -> uncheck
   It worked!
   The following didn't work and/or don't exist any more:
      defaults write com.google.Chrome.plist AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool FALSE
      defaults write com.google.Chrome       AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool FALSE
      chrome://flags/#overscroll-history-navigation

Q: how do I upgrade chrome on mac?
A: I think Chrome -> About  will show if an update is available

Q: When I run `google-chrome foo.png` from a shell, it brings up the image
   in a new tab, as expected.
   But when I try to open foo.png from inside google-chrome
   after downloading it, it opens up some other helper viewer
   that I usually don't like.
   What is that helper, and how can I get chrome to just bring up
   the image in a tab, instead?
PA:
   The helper is called `eog` ("eye of gnome").
   If, instead of clicking the .png file in the download bar, I just say ctrl-o and open it, it does the right thing.
   So it's just the download bar that's weird.
   Maybe one of the following is relevant?
     ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list
     /usr/share/applications/
     /usr/local/share/applications/

Q: blue #0000ff was coming out as 002eff = rgb(0,46,255) on my monitor at work, according to color picker!? wtf?
  maybe relevant: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/74h5yh/blue_shows_as_purple_in_chrome/
  they suggest chrome://flags/#force-color-profile
  huh, changing color profile from "Default" to sRGB fixed it.
  Q: wtf does that mean?
