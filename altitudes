Trying to put together a proof of the following statement:

Given a non-degenerate (i.e. nonzero volume) tetrahedron T
which is the the convex hull of its vertices {v0,v1,v2,v3} in R^3,

Define the function h_T : S^2 -> R
by h_T(u) = max {p . u : p in T}
          - min {p . u : p in T}
or equivalently (since {v0,v1,v2,v3} is the convex hull of T)
   h_T(u) = max {v0 . u, v1 . u, v2 . u, v3 . u}
          - min {v0 . u, v1 . u, v2 . u, v3 . u}.                       (1)
Informally, h_T is the "height of T in direction u".

Note that, since h_T(u) = h_T(-u), we can safely refer to h_T
of the direction of a line or segment, meaning
h_T of either of the two opposite unit vectors
parallel to the line or segment.

Define the "altitudes" of T to be the following 7 line segments:
    segment joining v0 to closest point on opposite face plane
    segment joining v1 to closest point on opposite face plane
    segment joining v2 to closest point on opposite face plane
    segment joining v3 to closest point on opposite face plane
    shortest segment joining the line v0,v1 to the line v2,v3
    shortest segment joining the line v0,v2 to the line v3,v1
    shortest segment joining the line v0,v3 to the line v1,v2

Define the "interior altitudes" of T to be those altitudes
of T that (excluding endpoints) lie inside the interior of T.
Note that an altitude that lies on the boundary of T is NOT an interior altitude.

Proposition: Given a non-degenerate tetrahedron T in R^3,
h_T : S^2 -> R is continuous
and its local minima are exactly the directions
of the interior altitudes of T.

Corollary: Every shortest altitude of T is an interior altitude of T.
Proof of Corollary (from Proposition):

    Assume a is an altitude of T that is not an interior altitude;
    we must show that there is another altitude
    b that is strictly shorter than a.

    Since a does not lie inside the interior of T,
    Proposition tells us that the direction of a is not a local minimum of h_T;
    therefore it is not a global minimum of h_T.
    Since h_T is continuous on a compact set,
    it does achieve a global minimum (possibly more than one)
    in some direction. By Proposition, that direction
    is parallel to some altitude b that *does* lie in the interior
    of T.
    Since dir(b) is a global minimum and dir(a) is not, we have
        h_T(dir(b)) < h_T(dir(a)).
    But h_T of the direction of an altitude is simply the length of that
    altitude; therefore
        length(b) = h_T(dir(b))
                  < h_T(dir(a))
                  = length(a)
    so b is a shorter altitude than a, as desired.


Proof that h_T is continuous:
    This follows from the continuity of each of the four functions
    u |-> v_i . u, and the closure of the class of continuous functions
    under finite max, min, and difference.
    [XXX actually I think it is true even if T is any compact
    set in R^3... what is a proof for that??]


Proof that every local minimum of h_T is parallel to an altitude of T:

    First note that the altitude directions u
    are exactly those directions in which all four vertices
    are extremal, i.e. in which either:
        one vertex has the largest dot product with u
            and the other 3 have the smallest, or
        three vertices have the largest dot product with u
            and the other one has the smallest, or
        two vertices have the largest dot product with u
            and the other two have the smallest.

    Therefore if we have a unit vector u that is *not* the direction
    of any altitude of T, then there is some vertex v_i that is *not*
    extremal in direction u.  We want to show that, in this case,
    u is not a local mimimum of h_T,
    i.e. that every open neighborhood of u in S^2, no matter how small,
    contains a unit vector u' for which h_T(u') < h_T(u).

    So, start with a non-altitude direction u
    and an open neighborhood N of u in S^2.
    Let
        Smin = {v_i | v_i.u = min{v0.u, v1.u, v2.u, v3.u}}
        Smax = {v_i | v_i.u = max{v0.u, v1.u, v2.u, v3.u}}
        Smid = {v0,v1,v2,v3} / (Smin U Smax)
    then, Smin,Smid,Smax form a disjoint union of {v0,v1,v2,v3}
    and, as we noted above, Smid is nonempty,
    so Smin U Smax has at most 3 points.
    Also, since T is nondegenerate, each of Smin and Smax is nonempty.

    Let P be a plane that includes the (at most 3) points of Smin U Smax.
    Note that u is NOT normal to P (since the dot product of u
    with points of V is not constant,
    since at least one dot product is at
    min{v0.u, v1.u, v2.u, v3.u} and one other is at
    max{v0.u, v1.u, v2.u, v3.u}, and these are different by nondegeneracy of T).
    Choose a unit vector v normal to P, such that v dot u >= 0
    (if one of the two opposite unit normal vectors of P has negative
    dot product with u, then use the other one).

    The idea will be that, if we perturb u by adding a bit of v to it
    (a small enough perturbation so that the points in Smin, Smax and Smid still
    have smallest, largest, and non-extremal dot products, respectively,
    with the perturbed direction, and also small enough so that
    we stay inside the neighborhood N), then
    the effect will be to decrease the height of T in the new direction.

    We know that smid dot u < smid dot u < smax dot u
    for each of the finitely many smin in Smin, smid in Smid, smax in Smax,
    so by continuity of dot product with each of these finitely many points,
    there exists eps0 small enough
    so that for each u' such that ||u'-u|| < eps0,
        smid dot u' < smid dot u' < smax dot u'
    for each smin in Smin, smid in Smid, smax in Smax.
    Choose such an eps0,
    also small enough so that ||u'-u|| < eps0 implies u' in N.

    Let eps be small enough so that  || ((u + eps v)/||u + eps v||) - u ||
    < eps0, and let u' = (u + eps v)/||u + eps v||.
    Then by definition of eps0, we know that
        smid dot u' < smid dot u' < smax dot u'                    (2)
    for each smin in Smin, smid in Smid, smax in Smax.


    For each vi in Smin U Smax,
        vi . u' = vi . (u + eps v)/||u + eps v||
                = (vi.u + eps vi.v) / ||u + eps v||
(3)             = vi.u / ||u + eps v||           since vi.v == 0 since vi in P

    Also since u dot v >= 0 and u != v, we have:
        ||u + eps v|| > 1                                          (4)

        h_T(u') = max{v0.u', v1.u',v2.u',v3.u'}
                - min{v0.u', v1.u',v2.u',v3.u'}
                = max{smax dot u' : smax in Smax}
                - min{smin dot u' : smin in Smin}                by (2)
                = max{smax.u / ||u + eps v|| : smax in Smax}
                - min{smin.u / ||u + eps v|| : smin in Smin}
                = (max{smax.u : smax in Smax}
                 - min{smin.u : smin in Smin}) / ||u + eps v||
                = h_T(u) / ||u + eps v||
                < h_T(u)   by (4) (and since h_T > 0 by definition and nondegeneracy of T)
    So u' is a point in N for which h_T(u') < h_T(u), which was what was wanted.


Proof that every local minimum of h_T is in the direction of an interior altitude of T:
    Let u be a local minimum of h_T.
    We just showed that u is the direction of some altitude a of T;
    we now have to show that a is an interior altitude.

    Assume not; we will derive a contradiction.
    Let Smin and Smax be the vertices of T with minimum and maximum
    dot product with u; then Smin U Smax = {v0,v1,v2,v3}.

    We start by finding a unit vector v perpendicular to u, and constant c,
    such that smin dot v <= c for all smin in Smin,
          and smax dot v >= c for all smax in Smax.

      In the case that |Smax| = 1 and |Smin| = 3 (i.e. if a is a vertex-face altitude),
      we find such a v as follows:
      project the single vertex in Smax onto the plane of the opposite face whose vertices are Smin.
      The projected point won't be in the interior of the face
      (for that would imply a is an interior altitude of T) so
      it must be on or outside (at least) one of the face's 3 side lines.
      Let v be that side's outward normal, in the plane of Smin (i.e. normal to u),
      and let c be v's dot product with any point on that side.
      Then smax dot v >= c for the single vertex smax in Smax,
      and smin dot v <= c for each of the three vertices in Smin, as desired.
      The opposite case, |Smax| = 3 and |Smax| = 1, is analogous.
      The final case is when |Smax| = 2 and |Smin| = 2, i.e. a is an edge-edge altitude.
      If each of the two endpoints of a were in the interior of its respective edge of T,
      then a would be an interior altitude, contrary to assumption;
      therefore (at least) one of a's endpoints is either exactly at the end of its edge of T,
      or outside of T entirely.
      Assume without loss of generality that it is the Smax edge of T that does not contain
      its endpoint of a in its interior.
      Let v be either of the two opposite unit normals of the edge of Smin
      in the plane that is normal to u (i.e. v = u cross direction of edge of Smin)
      and let c be v's dot product with either point of Smin.
      Then either
          smax dot v <= c for all smax in Smax
      or  smax dot v >= c for all smax in Smax
      (since if, to the contrary, the two points in Smax have opposite dot product with v,
      that would mean that altitude endpoint lies strictly between the two vertices
      of Smax, contrary to assumption).

    So now we have a vector v and a constant c as we said.

    [XXX GET RID I THINK]
    Let P = {p in R^3 : p dot v = c}.
    Then u is parallel to P,
    and Smin and Smax lie (not necessarily strictly) on opposite sides of P.

    The idea now will be that, if we perturb u by moving it a bit away from v,
    then the effect will be to decrease the height of T in the new direction.
    We will do this while working inside an arbitrarily small
    neighborhood around u, so that will give a contradiction of the fact that u is a local minimum of h_T.
