The following are useful distinctions to keep in mind:
    prescriptive/descriptive
    intent/extent
    logical/physical
    specification/implementation
    public/private
    is-a/has-a
Lots of arguments / bugs / unmaintainable code / suffering
arises from people taking something that's the RHS and assuming it is,
or should be treated as, the LHS.
